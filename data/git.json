You can also just do two of these tags, that might actually be better, with one maybe being less specific.

It is a classical effect and the voltage thus increases linearly according to Ohms law R=V/I\n\n** Specifically, the characterization of the CHE is that the transversal current varies linearly with the strength of the magnetic field and that the longitudinal resistance is small but nonvanishing\n\nI'm not sure why the longitudinal resistance is super important, but i guess it is just \"normal\" resistance\n\n** Shockingly, this isnt\n\nThe transversal (Hall) resistance turns out not to vary clean an d linearly, but is quantized at $R_H = h/e^2v$ .\nThe longitudinal resistance turns out to vanish when the Hall resistance is a multiple of R_H\n\n$\\nu$ is called the filling factor, its the ratio between the filled and empty electron states, and has both fractional and integer values, shockingly called the integer and fractional quantum hall effect respectively.\n\n** The FQHE is said to be explained by using quasiparticles interacting with impurities. These quasiparticles have _fractional quantum statistics_ and are thus _anyons_\n\nThis is the important part of course, and one which is not at all obvious.\n\nThe chain of explanation is thus the other way around of how Shech brings it:\n\n*** We expect classical hall effect\n\n*** We see weird things suchs as fractional filling\n\n*** We say \"ah those are just quasiparticles\"\n\n*** these quasi particles obey fractional quantum statistics i.e. are interchangeable more than bosons and anyons\n\n*** Because they do that their fundamental group must be B_n, which cannot be\n\n*** Thus no approximate instantiation\n\n** However, in 4.2 Shech seems to switch to want to explain the Emergence of anyons, not the FQHE.\n\n\"What explains the emergence of anyons, i.e., particles pbeying fractional quantum statistics?\" pp1975\n\n** The standard story explains this by appeal to the difference of the fundamental groups of 2D and 3D.\n\nThis appeals to some abstract mathematical structure, one which according to Leng should be approximately instantiated\n\nThis explanation is similar to asymptotic explanation, in the sense that all fqhe systems can exhibit anyons, it's not limited to a particular compound.\n\n\n\n* The order of explanation for Shech\n\n** He has two claims:\n\n*** Physical FQHE systems instantiate the (abstract mathematical) structure corresponding to 2D configuration space\n\n*** Fractional statistics \"exists\" because...\n\n**** The phase factor characteizing quantum statiss is the one dimensional unitary representation of the fundamental group of a systemis configuration space\n\n**** In two dimensions the fundamental group is the Braid group\n\n** This leads to\n\nUs no longer being able to say that the physical system is \"approximately instantiated\", as $3D \\napprox 2D$\n\n\n\n** TAKEAWAY\n\nShech's explanation is pretty messy, it's not clear what is doing the explaining and what is explained.

Crucially, one rather popular explanation of the FQHE necessarily employs an infinitesimal idealization, namely that the configuration space of the electrons involved is 2D. The configuration space of electrons is always 3D, so this is a classic example of an idealization as a fiction used to explain something. However, contra cite:Strevens2019a, I argue that this idealization cannot be construed as one which gets rid of a variable irrelevant to the explanation, as this infinite idealization is /crucial/ to the whole explanation: without it there is no explanation.\n\nBut, I am getting ahead of myself. The FQHE is not easily summarized in a short paragraph, and the rest of this chapter will be dedicated to providing a rudimentary understanding of the effect and its \"causes\".\n\n\n** The [[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\nBefore we start to describe the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, we should first understand Quantum Hall effects more generally. To do /that/, a short description of the classical Hall Effect is in order.\n\nThe classical Hall effect can be briefly described as the measurement of a voltage /across/ (transversally) a thin conducting plate trough which a current is run in the longitudinal direction and which is subject to a magnetic field perpendicular to both, as in Figure \\ref{fig:che}\n\n#+caption: set up of the che, stolen from cite:Shech2019\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:che\n[[./media/che.png]]\n\nClassically, we can explain the observation of this voltage by the fact that the electrons travelling in the longitudinal direction experience a Lorentz force $\\textbf{F} = q\\textbf{E} + q\\textbf{v} \\times \\textbf{B}$, which causes them to be redirected to one of the sides of the plate. This leads to a gradient of electrons along the transversal axis, i.e. a voltage difference. Instead of a voltage, the resistance is usually measured.\n\nThe classical Hall effect is relatively well understood and, frankly, quite boring.\n\nThe classical quantum hall effect happens around .......\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect(s)\n:LOGBOOK:\nCLOCK: [2021-03-09 Tue 09:51]\n:END:\n\nThings start to get more interesting once the strength of the magnetic field is increased quite a bit. We start to observe plateaux at regular intervals in the transversal resistance.\n#+caption: qhe\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe.png]]\n\nWe would of course like to know what explains the appearance of these plateaux.\n\nAt even stronger magnetic fields and even cleaner samples, we start to see even more plateaux.\n\n\n...\n\nLet us first focus our attention on the lower magnetic field range, which gives rise to the socalled /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/. First observed in XXXX by YY, the effect gets its name from the plateaux appearing at integer multiples of the \"quantum of resistance\".\n\n** Quantum of Resistance\n\n\\[R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi\\]\n\n\nThis is strange, as from the classical quantum hall effect we expect the transversal resistance to vary linearly with the strength of the magnetic field.\n\n** Landau levels\n\nThe IQHE comes from the impurities present in the sample: the \"pure\" energy eigenstates of the system would not lead plateaux. The impurities can be modeled as a random potential. This random potential breaks the degeneracy of the Landau levels and \"smooths them out\", like\n#+caption: smooth landau, stolen from Tong.\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:nondegenlandau\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\nIn addition, the disorder causes the energy levels to be split up into /extended/ and /localized/ energy states, like\n#+caption: extended v localized, also Tong\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended v localized\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nOnly the extended energy levels carry current, the localized ones do not. Furthermore, the extended ones are favored? In any case, as the magnetic field strength increases, so does the energy of the states, so they get pushed up to a new energy level. However, they first have to fill the localized states before they are able to reach a new extended state, and all these localized states do not conduct i.e. do not contribute to the conductivity i.e. do not change the resistance of the material. Tada, you got plateaux.\n\nAt this point one may have some questions: these extended states sound like they are about the longitudinal resistance, not the transversal. Furthermore, if the extended states gets less populated and the localized states more populated over the course of a plateaux, why does the resistivity not just shoot up since there are so many less conductive states?\n\nThe answer to the latter is that the extended states will end up conducting more, somehow.\n","added":true,"removed":false}],"additions":794,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210309112947-sorites_paradox.org","oid":"a3f462b66bba9a09267181d50e5b0fb0a7b762ee","diff":[{"count":5,"value":"#+title: sorites paradox\n#+roam_tags: thesis vagueness\n","added":true,"removed":false}],"additions":5,"deletions":0}],"additions":804,"deletions":0},{"oid":"490a5a92e191f60bc0027775cb0abe99b818f3b4","message":"March 12\n","date":1615570131,"files":[{"filepath":"20210210121252-fractional_quantum_hall_effect_meta.org","oid":"0e49e617bd8174fb2f921494597e2d4f6c7ee895","diff":[{"count":83,"value":"#+title: Fractional quantum hall effect (meta)\n#+roam_tags: FQHE idealizations thesis\n\n* Papers\n\n** Philosophy\n\n- cite:Shech2019\n- cite:Shech2015a\n- cite:Bain2016\n- cite:saundersExplanationQuantumStatistics2006a\n\ncite:Shech2019\n\n** Science\n\n- cite:Tong2016\n\ncite:Arovas2020\n"},{"count":5,"added":true,"value":"\ncite:Stern2008a\n"}],"additions":1,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210216120554-notes_on_fqhe.org","oid":"cd265242d7d6736a121cafec4524935ec5b8f73c","diff":[{"count":737,"value":"#+title: notes on FQHE\n#+roam_tags: FQHE\n\n\n* Context\n\nHere I want to provide some general thoughts about the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect ([[file:20210218151906-descripion_of_qhe.org][descripion of QHE]]) which I will follow up on later, based solely on cite:Tong2016,Arovas2020 with the goal of claryfying the claims made in cite:Shech2019\n\n\n* Shechs claims about the fqhe\n\n** Particles should behave the same if you spin the system around 360\n\nSo the wavefunction $\\Psi_0$ = $1\\Psi_{360}$. We could see this as spinning it around 180 degrees twice, so $A_{180}^2\\Psi = 1\\Psi$, so $A_{180}=\\pm 1$.\n\nRotations are usually represented with an exponent, so we can generalize to\n\\[\n\\Psi_\\theta = e^{i\\theta}\\Psi_0\n\\]\n\nIt seems to be the case that only $\\theta=0,\\pi$ happens in our normal world, leading to bosons and fermions respectively.\n\n** There are two ways of understanding /why/ this happens: the _operator_ framework and the _configuration space_ framework\n\n*** What are they?\n\n** According to Landsman 2016, the operator and configuration space framework are identical in dimensions greater than two.\n\n** In the configuration space framework for understanding  permutation invariance, in two dimensions the \"exchange phase\" $\\theta$ can take on any value and gives rise to \"anyons\"\n\nSo this does NOT count for the operator framework.\n\n** This is because only in the conf framework, there are two theorems which say that $e^i\\theta$ is equivalent to the _\"one-dimensional unitary representation\"_ $\\gamma$ of the _\"fundamental group\"_  $\\pi_1$\n\nThese fundamental groups are\n\\[\\pi_1(Q)=B_N \\text{ (Braid Group) for } d=2\\]\n\\[\\pi_1(Q)=S_N \\text{ (permutation group) for } d=3\\]\n\nThis has alledgedly been shown by Arin 1947, Fadell and Neuwirth 1962, and Fox and Neuwirth 1962\n\n** The braid and permutation group have fundamentally different representations\n\nSn has $\\gamma=\\pm 1$, while Bn has $\\gamma_\\theta = e^i\\theta, 0\\leq\\theta\\leq 2\\pi$\n\n** The braid group unlike the permutation group cannot be approximately instantiated by physical space\n\n\n** The Hall voltage $V_h$ happens when a magnetic field perpendicular to a thin, current carrying conductor induces a Lorentz force and thus a potential difference across said conductor.\n\nThis is the _Hall Effect_.

Also it should be emphasized how universal this explanation is, such as the fact that the location of the bumps does not even depend on the material.\n\n\n*** c. It is argued that if this explanation would succeed in the way described above, we would have a reasonable case for an actual sectioning off of reality? Here it must be clear why this effect is so useful to study, but also what I will do when it does not turn out to be so dramatic, i.e. how I will generalize\n\n** Part II (Long, ~10k): The details of the FQHE are laid bare, with little interpretation going on in order for the actual \"explanation\" of the effect to be as clear as possible, mostly based on Tong\n\n*** d. The groundwork needed for the explanation to get things of the ground is laid: the CHE is explained in more detail, Landau levels are introduced and the distinction between the Integer and Fractional QHE is clarified, and the former is (for now) made clear to be less important to explain\n\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n*****  To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n*****  Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting a vibe of the thing\n\n***** Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n...\n\n**** Quantization\n\n***** The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n***** First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n*****  From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n***** Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n*****  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\nOperators are functions which spit out other functions, rather than a scalar or vector.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTada\n\n**** Important details and idealizations\n\n***** Astute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\n***** An additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n[[file:20210223162026-the_dimensions_of_the_hall_system_is_set_to_2_from_the_start.org][The dimensions of the Hall system is set to 2 from the start]]\n\n\n*** e. The FQHE is set up in more detail, with the goal of making clear which idealizing assumptions are made, such as the LWF, the plasma analogy and why the toy model is needed.

However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n****** The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n\n***** For those reasons we will be skipping a thorough examination of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect and jump straight into the FQHE\n\n**** FQHE\n\n***** The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n****** Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former.

In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named \"anyons\".\n\nA particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.\n\n** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space\n\nHow do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?\nWe have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.\n\nAs mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.\n\nUsing the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.\n\n** Naive exchange\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):\n\nWe start out with a wavefunction $\\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_1\\psi_2\\]\n\nIf we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [[file:20210210115635-phase_transitions.org][phase transitions]]\n\n\\[\\Psi_\\pi=e^{i\\theta\\pi}\\psi_2\\psi_1\\]\n\nExchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with\n\n\\[\\Psi_{2\\pi}=e^{i2\\pi\\theta}\\Psi_0\\]\n\nTherefore, $e^{i2\\pi\\theta}=1 \\rightarrow e^{i\\pi\\theta}=\\pm 1$, which leads to $\\theta=0 \\lor \\theta=1$.\n\nWe have therefore \"shown\" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\\theta=0$) and fermions ($\\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.\n\n** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not \"the operator framework\" )\n\nWhat we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.\n\n(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)\n\nThe three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation\n\n\\begin{equation}\n[S_i,S_j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K\n    \\label{eq:spincomm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nIf we take the state $\\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^2\\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:spinsquared}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\nS_3\\ket{s,m}=m\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:s3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nthen we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^+\\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\\ket{s,m+1}=\\ket{s,m'}\n    \\label{eq:splus}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf we require $\\sqrt{|\\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\ns(s+1)-m(m+1)\\geq0 \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:posnorm}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq s \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:ms}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIt is clear then, that for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so\n\\begin{equation}\ns-m= n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:int}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimilarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s=n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:mpluss}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining \\eqref{eq:int} and \\eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s+s-m=2s=n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow s=\\frac{n}{2}\n    \\label{eq:proofofinteger}\n\\end{equation}\nSince $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.\n\nSo, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.\n\n*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng\n\n*** TODO Spin statistics relation\n\n\n** Configuration space framework\n\nThe above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.\n\nLuckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows\n\n1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles\n2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space\n3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange\n\nIt almost seems too easy.\n\nLet's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).\n\nWithout any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^d \\otimes \\mathbb{R}^d\\]\n\nHowever, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.\n\n\n\nWe need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )\n\nLet us call the set of diagonal points $\\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\\mathbf{r}=(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})$.\n\n\nThen, for our configuration space looks like\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbb{R}^d \\otimes \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d  - \\Delta }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:confspaceddim}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=just blantantly copied=\nIn order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can \"discard\" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in\n\\begin{equation}\nS=\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d -\\Delta}{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:S}\n\\end{equation}\n\nBefore showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....\n\n*** 3D\nLet's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\\Delta$, which for $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1 -\\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).\n\n[[./media/3dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\n\n=Copying again=\n\nAn exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be \"looping it around\" the sphere (path C).\n\nWhat is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.\n\nNow we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha^2=+1 \\rightarrow \\alpha = \\pm 1\n    \\label{eq:doubleexchange}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.\n\n\n*** 2D\n\nLet us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.\n\n[[./media/2dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 2D exchange\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\nWe make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.\n\nHowever, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the \"string\" cannot collapse to single point in principle.\n\nTherefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\\alpha$ has no effect on $|\\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}\n    \\label{eq:phasephase}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n*** Connection to the Braid group\n\nThe above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way? The answer lies in a theorem????\n\nQuantum statistics of a particle are the 1D representation of the [[file:20210403175440-first_homotopy_group_pi_1.org][First homotopy group pi_1]]/[[file:20210218153905-fundamental_group.org][fundamental group]] of the configuration space.\n\n(Why are the QS that? Is this a theorem? If so, when does it apply?)\n\n\n\n*** The relation between phase and connectedness of a space\n\n\nFor $d=2$ the fundamental group is the Braid group.\n\nThe 1D rep of the braid group is $e^{i\\theta} \\quad \\theta\\in[0,2\\pi]$\n\n\n* Critique\n\nThe main crux of my critique lies in the (in my eyes) unnecessary assumption that the quantum statistics of a particle can /only/ be determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space. While this might work as a prediction, i.e. if we can figure out the configuration space and then the fundamental group, we might reasonably expect to find particles with such and such quantum statistics there.\n\nHowever, I do not find this very satisfactory as an explanation, it feels much too close to a DN way of explaining things, which, as we know [[file:20210330165632-problems_with_the_dn_model.org][DN cannot determine whether something is a difference maker]]. That is, the explanation works backwards: instead of ending uncontrovertably with the most controversial point, namely that the configuration space of the anyons is 2D, it arrives there kind of casually.\n\n\n\nThe order of explanation as it is usually given is like this:\n1. We have observed fractional quantum statistics (alledgedly, i'm willing to grant that at this point)\n2. /The quantum statistics of the particle are determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space/\n3. The 1D rep of the Braid group is fractional quantum statistics\n4. The Braid group is the first homotopy group of a non-simply connected 2D configuration space\n5. Therefore particles which exhibit fractional quantum statistics need to have a 2D configuration space\n\n\nNow, if all of the above steps /necessarily/ are /if and only ifs/, this argument is rather water tight. However, I would dispute that this is the case here, first and foremost on the grounds that this conclusion is /primae facie/ unacceptable and a paradox, so something seems to go wrong here. We can either resolve this paradox by correcting our physics to allow for precisely 2D configuration spaces, or, what seems more agreeable to me, by not allowing the argument to reach this conclusion, as I do not believe every single on of the steps above are if and only ifs.\n\nSpecifically, I have trouble with step 2, as we appear to need some theorem in order to establish this but I have not really found such a theorem, just vague gestures to the fact that these statistics come from the worldlines being intertwined and whatnot.\n\nThe other way around the explanation looks a lot less secure\n\n1. The configuration space describing the exchange of two identical particles contains a hole in the origin and is thus non-simply connected\n2. Such a space has an infinite number of homotopy classes of equivalent (i.e. continuously deformable into each other) paths\n3. The fundamental group/first homotopy group of these paths is the Braid group\n4. The 1D rep of this group is $e^{i\\theta}$\n5. /This is the spin of the particles we are interested in/\n\n\n** The problem with treating this as a DN explanation\n\nThe problem with treating this a DN explanation is that that requires that the Laws of Nature used are true and ALSO the events described as premises. However, there are not really any of the latter, as we can't take the existence of a 2D things as a premise, as that is weird.\n\n[[file:20210405144616-eia_allows_us_to_verify_dn_premises.org][EIA allows us to verify DN premises]]\n\n\n* Brief critique summary\n\n** Leng says: \"Platonism is not real, because we can just say that physical space approximately instantiates mathematical structures, so we don't need that exactness\"\n\n** Shech says: \"We cannot use approximate instantiation if we assume approximation means how Norton says it and if we use the EIA. Then anyons in the FQHE show that something is real but not cannot be approximately instantiated, namely 2D space\".\npp 1977\n\"The fundamental group of approximately 2D is the same as that of 3D, namely $S_n$.\" \"For anyons, we need fundamental group to be $B_n$, and /this can only occur in exactly 2D/.\"\n\"Yet, physical systems are not exactly 2D.\"\n\"Thus, it cannot be said that a physical system 'approximately instantiates' the braid group structure necessary for fractional statistics.\"\n\nIn short: YOU CANNOT HAVE **BRAID GROUP STRUCTURE* IN 3D.\n\nI say: YES YOU CAN, IF YOU BELIEVE HARD ENOUGH.\n\n** I say:\n\n*** That's not a great argument because the explanation we get from the anyon case/how Shech defines it is not strong enough to factor into the EIA\n\n*** Moreover: This /is/ / can be seen as a case of approximate instantiation!\n\nI aim to show that the Shech's claim that \"it cannot be said that a physical system approximately instantiates the braid group structure\" is false, and we can indeed say that a physical system can approximate such things, just not in the way that Shech thinks about it. The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.\n\nInstead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.\n\nWith \"finding an alternative route\", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.\n1. Bob takes anti-conception pills\n2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant\nC. Bob does not become pregnant.\n\nWhile we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with. This idealization might not be as problematic however. (this is later or earlier, haven't figured out where to put it)\n\n=garbo=\nNext, we have an equally unpromising candidate, which is the \"mini-explanation\". The fundamental group of 2D exchange under two particles is the Braid group\nE. The fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of $N$ identical particles in 2D is $B_N$\nL. The quantum statistics of a particle is the 1D rep of the fundamental group of the ...\nC. The quantum statistics of 2D particles are anyonic i.e. $e^{i\\theta}$\n(I'm being loose with the structure here, as otherwise it would be a huge drag to write everything out, i.e. \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of two identical particles is $e^{i\\theta}$\", \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group ... are the quantum statistics\", .... (secretly I don't really know how to write this out DN style as the example laws are always extremely simple conditionals, nor do I really know how to transfer this to theorems rather than laws. If this is a big problem we can discuss this, I think more likely I will have to get rid of the reference to the DN explanation or formulate this differently entirely. Regardless, this is more an example of how I wish to argue))\n=garbo=\n\n...\n\nThe most promising candidate for such an intervention is centered around the fundamental group of the system, but not in the way that the argument is presented by Shech. Instead let us examine how the argument goes once more:\n\nWe see the Quantum Hall Effect manifest\n\n* Checklist\n\nTo show it can be approximated, I need to show that there are /some/ paths which are nondeformable into one another/non collapsible to a point. In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*\n\n** Options\n\n*** Particles have nonzero size\n\nIn these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.\n\n*** Not ALL paths\n\nWhile the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.\n\n\n*** Winding can be something different?\nThe main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Junk\n\nStartingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.\n\nHowever, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one. While I agree the 3D space cannot approximate 2D space if the property under consideration is connectedness as presented, I do think it is possible for some other factor down the argumentative line to be considered \"approximately instantiated\" in the Nortonian sense.\n\nWe just need to find a different path to \"fit in\" to the explanation of the possibility of anyons, i.e. either\n1. 2D space is approximately instatiated in the experiment due to thinness and strong fields, giving rise to something with the same properties as 2D space\n2. Holes are approximately instantiated, for instance ??\n3. Connectedness is approximate, in the sense that we don't care about /all/ paths but just most paths, and we can create a lot of paths which don't work well\n4. Homotopy classes are approximate, in the sense that we don't derive the homotopy classes from the connectedness of the space but from looking at different paths and seeing that they /don't/ act the same way. rather than that they /can't/ act the same way\n5. Fundamental group is approximate, in the sense that we don't look at all the homotopy classes but look at what kind of behavior the elements of the group have\n6. 1D rep is approximate. I don't see how this would work.\n7. Equivalence between spin is approximate, in the sense that there is some other physical mechanism which causes the phase to be such which does not rely on the above, such as the Berry phase calculation.\n\n\nSo, which of these is the most likely canditate for approximate instantiation?\n","added":true,"removed":false}],"additions":4007,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210403122310-a_knot_is_a_braid_connected_back_to_itself.org","oid":"057be039d407d270954125f8b66dfda680748a14","diff":[{"count":37,"value":"#+title:

What is the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nIN 1982 some physicists did an experiment that gave a rather surprising result, weird plateaux.\n\n** 1.2. Why is it useful to look at\n\nThe FQHE has some interesting features which we should examine, specifically the way it is explained.\n\nIts explanation has a number of interesting features. For one, it is fairly nonrigorous. Secondly, it purportedly shows the existance of new kinds of particles, called anyons. Anyons will be the real focus in what is to follow.\n\n** 1.3 What are anyons\n\nAnyons are particles which have different statistics than fermions and bosons, which roughly corresponds with saying that they can have any kind of spin. As such they behave very differently, and might prove promising for a number of applications such as stable quantum computing.\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not onderbouwd however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n** 1.4 Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that the characterization of anyons given above does not refer to the quantum hall effect at all! This is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978. However, as we know from the LHC experiments looking for supersymmetry, theorizing is fun but we do need some experimental confirmation.\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more (wow great sentence), open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\nTo do so does require us to look at the FQHE in depth however, which we will do now.\n=Why do we need to look at this=\n\n\n*  The quantum hall effect\n\n** Once again, what is it\n\n*** Classical Hall effect\n\n[[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\n*** Preliminaries\n\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n#+transclude: t hlevel: 5\n[[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n\n\n**** Dawdling\nNow that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nInteger is somewhat interesting but only insofar as it allows us to sort of get why the plateuax are there, although this explanation does not really work for the FQHE as it does not take electron interactions into account which are crucial\n#BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  IQHE\n\n\n***  Landaus\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223165225-landau_levels_in_an_electric_field.org][Landau levels in an electric field]]\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223160810-derivation_of_landau_levels_for_qhe.org][derivation of Landau levels for QHE]]\n\n\n***  Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\nImpurities\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[file:20210223142953-disordered_systems_exhibit_iqhe_more_strongly.org][disordered systems exhibit IQHE MORE strongly]]\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n [[file:20210302155202-impurities_break_the_degeneracy_of_the_landau_levels.org][impurities break the degeneracy of the landau levels]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n [[file:20210302160720-impurities_turn_many_quantum_states_from_extended_to_localized.org][impurities turn many quantum states from extended to localized]]\n\n\n However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample.

The configuration space explanation chapter\n#+roam_tags: FQHE anyons chapter\n#+STARTUP: latexpreview\n#+LATEX_HEADER: \\usepackage{braket}\n\n* The configuration space explanation of anyons\n\nIn this section I will give a brief expose of the purported explanation of the possibility/emergence of anyons via the \"configuration space framework\", mostly based on cite:Shech2019, cite:Shech2015b, cite:Rao2001 and cite:Tong2016.\n\n\n** The quantum statistics of a particle are the phase factor it obtains under exchange\n\nThe quantum statistics of a particle is the \"factor\" the system picks up under exchange of two identical particles. In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named \"anyons\".\n\nA particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.\n\n** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space\n\nHow do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?\nWe have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.\n\nAs mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.\n\nUsing the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.\n\n** Naive exchange\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):\n\nWe start out with a wavefunction $\\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_1\\psi_2\\]\n\nIf we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [[file:20210210115635-phase_transitions.org][phase transitions]]\n\n\\[\\Psi_\\pi=e^{i\\theta\\pi}\\psi_2\\psi_1\\]\n\nExchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with\n\n\\[\\Psi_{2\\pi}=e^{i2\\pi\\theta}\\Psi_0\\]\n\nTherefore, $e^{i2\\pi\\theta}=1 \\rightarrow e^{i\\pi\\theta}=\\pm 1$, which leads to $\\theta=0 \\lor \\theta=1$.\n\nWe have therefore \"shown\" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\\theta=0$) and fermions ($\\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.\n\n** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not \"the operator framework\" )\n\nWhat we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.\n\n(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)\n\nThe three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation\n\n\\begin{equation}\n[S_i,S_j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K\n    \\label{eq:spincomm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nIf we take the state $\\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^2\\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:spinsquared}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\nS_3\\ket{s,m}=m\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:s3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nthen we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^+\\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\\ket{s,m+1}=\\ket{s,m'}\n    \\label{eq:splus}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf we require $\\sqrt{|\\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\ns(s+1)-m(m+1)\\geq0 \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:posnorm}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq s \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:ms}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIt is clear then, that for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so\n\\begin{equation}\ns-m= n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:int}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimilarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s=n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:mpluss}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining \\eqref{eq:int} and \\eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s+s-m=2s=n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow s=\\frac{n}{2}\n    \\label{eq:proofofinteger}\n\\end{equation}\nSince $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.\n\nSo, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.\n\n*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng\n\n*** TODO Spin statistics relation\n\n\n** Configuration space framework\n\nThe above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.\n\nLuckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows\n\n1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles\n2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space\n3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange\n\nIt almost seems too easy.\n\nLet's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).\n\nWithout any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^d \\otimes \\mathbb{R}^d\\]\n\nHowever, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.\n\n\n\nWe need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )\n\nLet us call the set of diagonal points $\\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\\mathbf{r}=(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})$.\n\n\nThen, for our configuration space looks like\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathbb{R}^d \\otimes \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d  - \\Delta }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:confspaceddim}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=just blantantly copied=\nIn order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can \"discard\" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in\n\\begin{equation}\nS=\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d -\\Delta}{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:S}\n\\end{equation}\n\nBefore showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....\n\n*** 3D\nLet's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\\Delta$, which for $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1 -\\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).\n\n[[./media/3dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\n\n=Copying again=\n\nAn exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be \"looping it around\" the sphere (path C).\n\nWhat is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.\n\nNow we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha^2=+1 \\rightarrow \\alpha = \\pm 1\n    \\label{eq:doubleexchange}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.\n\n\n*** 2D\n\nLet us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.\n\n[[./media/2dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 2D exchange\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\nWe make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.\n\nHowever, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the \"string\" cannot collapse to single point in principle.\n\nTherefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\\alpha$ has no effect on $|\\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}\n    \\label{eq:phasephase}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n*** Connection to the Braid group\n\nThe above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way? The answer lies in a theorem????\n\nQuantum statistics of a particle are the 1D representation of the [[file:20210403175440-first_homotopy_group_pi_1.org][First homotopy group pi_1]]/[[file:20210218153905-fundamental_group.org][fundamental group]] of the configuration space.\n\n(Why are the QS that? Is this a theorem? If so, when does it apply?)\n\n\n\n*** The relation between phase and connectedness of a space\n\n\nFor $d=2$ the fundamental group is the Braid group.\n\nThe 1D rep of the braid group is $e^{i\\theta} \\quad \\theta\\in[0,2\\pi]$\n\n\n* Critique\n\nThe main crux of my critique lies in the (in my eyes) unnecessary assumption that the quantum statistics of a particle can /only/ be determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space. While this might work as a prediction, i.e. if we can figure out the configuration space and then the fundamental group, we might reasonably expect to find particles with such and such quantum statistics there.\n\nHowever, I do not find this very satisfactory as an explanation, it feels much too close to a DN way of explaining things, which, as we know [[file:20210330165632-problems_with_the_dn_model.org][DN cannot determine whether something is a difference maker]]. That is, the explanation works backwards: instead of ending uncontrovertably with the most controversial point, namely that the configuration space of the anyons is 2D, it arrives there kind of casually.\n\n\n\nThe order of explanation as it is usually given is like this:\n1. We have observed fractional quantum statistics (alledgedly, i'm willing to grant that at this point)\n2. /The quantum statistics of the particle are determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space/\n3. The 1D rep of the Braid group is fractional quantum statistics\n4. The Braid group is the first homotopy group of a non-simply connected 2D configuration space\n5. Therefore particles which exhibit fractional quantum statistics need to have a 2D configuration space\n\n\nNow, if all of the above steps /necessarily/ are /if and only ifs/, this argument is rather water tight. However, I would dispute that this is the case here, first and foremost on the grounds that this conclusion is /primae facie/ unacceptable and a paradox, so something seems to go wrong here. We can either resolve this paradox by correcting our physics to allow for precisely 2D configuration spaces, or, what seems more agreeable to me, by not allowing the argument to reach this conclusion, as I do not believe every single on of the steps above are if and only ifs.\n\nSpecifically, I have trouble with step 2, as we appear to need some theorem in order to establish this but I have not really found such a theorem, just vague gestures to the fact that these statistics come from the worldlines being intertwined and whatnot.\n\nThe other way around the explanation looks a lot less secure\n\n1. The configuration space describing the exchange of two identical particles contains a hole in the origin and is thus non-simply connected\n2. Such a space has an infinite number of homotopy classes of equivalent (i.e. continuously deformable into each other) paths\n3. The fundamental group/first homotopy group of these paths is the Braid group\n4. The 1D rep of this group is $e^{i\\theta}$\n5. /This is the spin of the particles we are interested in/\n\n\n** The problem with treating this as a DN explanation\n\nThe problem with treating this a DN explanation is that that requires that the Laws of Nature used are true and ALSO the events described as premises. However, there are not really any of the latter, as we can't take the existence of a 2D things as a premise, as that is weird.\n\n[[file:20210405144616-eia_allows_us_to_verify_dn_premises.org][EIA allows us to verify DN premises]]\n\n\n* Brief critique summary\n\n** Leng says: \"Platonism is not real, because we can just say that physical space approximately instantiates mathematical structures, so we don't need that exactness\"\n\n** Shech says: \"We cannot use approximate instantiation if we assume approximation means how Norton says it and if we use the EIA. Then anyons in the FQHE show that something is real but not cannot be approximately instantiated, namely 2D space\".\npp 1977\n\"The fundamental group of approximately 2D is the same as that of 3D, namely $S_n$.\" \"For anyons, we need fundamental group to be $B_n$, and /this can only occur in exactly 2D/.\"\n\"Yet, physical systems are not exactly 2D.\"\n\"Thus, it cannot be said that a physical system 'approximately instantiates' the braid group structure necessary for fractional statistics.\"\n\nIn short: YOU CANNOT HAVE **BRAID GROUP STRUCTURE* IN 3D.\n\nI say: YES YOU CAN, IF YOU BELIEVE HARD ENOUGH.\n\n** I say:\n\n*** That's not a great argument because the explanation we get from the anyon case/how Shech defines it is not strong enough to factor into the EIA\n\n*** Moreover: This /is/ / can be seen as a case of approximate instantiation!\n\nI aim to show that the Shech's claim that \"it cannot be said that a physical system approximately instantiates the braid group structure\" is false, and we can indeed say that a physical system can approximate such things, just not in the way that Shech thinks about it. The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.\n\nInstead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.\n\nWith \"finding an alternative route\", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.\n1. Bob takes anti-conception pills\n2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant\nC. Bob does not become pregnant.\n\nWhile we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with. This idealization might not be as problematic however. (this is later or earlier, haven't figured out where to put it)\n\n=garbo=\nNext, we have an equally unpromising candidate, which is the \"mini-explanation\". The fundamental group of 2D exchange under two particles is the Braid group\nE. The fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of $N$ identical particles in 2D is $B_N$\nL. The quantum statistics of a particle is the 1D rep of the fundamental group of the ...\nC. The quantum statistics of 2D particles are anyonic i.e. $e^{i\\theta}$\n(I'm being loose with the structure here, as otherwise it would be a huge drag to write everything out, i.e. \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of two identical particles is $e^{i\\theta}$\", \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group ... are the quantum statistics\", .... (secretly I don't really know how to write this out DN style as the example laws are always extremely simple conditionals, nor do I really know how to transfer this to theorems rather than laws. If this is a big problem we can discuss this, I think more likely I will have to get rid of the reference to the DN explanation or formulate this differently entirely. Regardless, this is more an example of how I wish to argue))\n=garbo=\n\n...\n\nThe most promising candidate for such an intervention is centered around the fundamental group of the system, but not in the way that the argument is presented by Shech. Instead let us examine how the argument goes once more:\n\nWe see the Quantum Hall Effect manifest\n\n* Checklist\n\nTo show it can be approximated, I need to show that there are /some/ paths which are nondeformable into one another/non collapsible to a point. In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*\n\n** Options\n\n*** Particles have nonzero size\n\nIn these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.\n\n*** Not ALL paths\n\nWhile the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.\n\n\n*** Winding can be something different?\nThe main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.\n\n"},{"count":5,"added":true,"value":"#+transclude: t"},{"count":1,"value":"\n"},{"count":14,"added":true,"value":"[[file:20210403175539-group.org][Group]]"},{"count":4,"value":"\n\n\n\n"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"\n"},{"count":739,"value":"* Junk\n\nStartingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.\n\nHowever, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one. While I agree the 3D space cannot approximate 2D space if the property under consideration is connectedness as presented, I do think it is possible for some other factor down the argumentative line to be considered \"approximately instantiated\" in the Nortonian sense.\n\nWe just need to find a different path to \"fit in\" to the explanation of the possibility of anyons, i.e. either\n1. 2D space is approximately instatiated in the experiment due to thinness and strong fields, giving rise to something with the same properties as 2D space\n2. Holes are approximately instantiated, for instance ??\n3. Connectedness is approximate, in the sense that we don't care about /all/ paths but just most paths, and we can create a lot of paths which don't work well\n4.

Fundamental group is approximate, in the sense that we don't look at all the homotopy classes but look at what kind of behavior the elements of the group have\n6. 1D rep is approximate.

As such they behave very differently, and might prove promising for a number of applications such as stable quantum computing.\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not onderbouwd however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n"},{"count":59,"added":true,"value":"This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n"},{"count":4,"value":"** 1."},{"count":154,"added":true,"value":"2.

However, as we know from the LHC experiments looking for supersymmetry, theorizing is fun but we do need some experimental confirmation.\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more (wow great sentence), open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\nTo do so does require us to look at the FQHE in depth however, which we will do now.\n=Why do we need to look at this=\n\n\n*  The quantum hall effect\n\n** Once again, what is it\n\n*** Classical Hall effect\n\n[[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\n*** Preliminaries\n\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field.

The property to be exploited to give this result is the non-0D nature of the particles under question, thus giving rise to a non-1D worldline.\n\nWhile according to all our best scientific theories electrons (and probably also the proposed anyons under question) are understood as point-particles under second quantization. Thus, /prima facie/, it does not seem likely to treat them as something else. However, two factors work in our favor here:\n1. The Pauli exclusion principle in combination with the inherent uncertainty in position\n2. The fact that the particles under question have like charge and would thus not be able to move arbitrarily close to one another.\n\nBoth of these will be argued for in more detail below, but for now I claim that /if/ $\\exists a\\geq \\beta\\in \\mathbb{R} \\quad \\Psi(r\\leq a)=0$, where \\beta is the then it's possible to see the system as being approximately two-dimensional.\n\nThe reasoning underlying this is that if the minimum distance between the particles is greater then the \"height\" of the configuration space, the 3d configuration space becomes multiply connected as well.\n\nImagine a box with a billiard ball in the middle which pokes out of the top and bottom, this is a reasonable model for now for the possible configurations of the particles. We need three conditions\n1. $\\Psi(r_i\\geq b_i)=0$ where $b_i \\quad i=x,y,z$ are the dimensions of the quantum hall system. This basically says: the probability of finding the particle outside the quantum hall system is $0$, which is not exactly true but for now works as a useful assumption, modeling the boundaries of the system as an infinite potential well\n2. $\\Psi(|r|\\leq a)=0$, where $a$ is some real number\n3. $b_x, b_y\\geq a \\geq b_z$ (or really any of the dimensions, it just needs to be )\n\nThis creates a sphere of forbidden particle positions around the origion (where the particles are near one another), which we can model as subtracting those points  $\\sigma$ from the configuration space. Since \\sigma encompasses the points \\Delta, we can leave out \\Delta. Furthermore, since we are excising the points outside of the QH system, we need to replace $\\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with $\\mathbb{B}^3$, which are the points ranging from $[-\\frac{b_i}{2},+\\frac{b_i}{2}] \\quad i=x,y,z$ being the limits of the system.

Kind of confusing.\n- Thermodynamic limit\n- Plane with low friction -> plane with lower friction ->...-> plane with no friction\n**** Direct\nIdealization in which the relevant parameter is directly set to zero or infinity or whatever, rather than using the limiting operation to influence this.\nThese are never problematic in the way described  below.\n- Plane with low friction -> plane with lower friction -> ... -> plane with no friction\n\n\n**** Indirect\nInfnite idealization in which some parameter is set to zero or infinity in order to set some other parameter to zero or non-zero.\n- Infinite population -> zero genetic drift (problematic)\n- (non-problematic example)\n- ???\n***** Problematic\nIndirect infinite idealization where the setting of a parameter to zero leads to a problem, but the idealization is still used (kind of a moot point since the only idealizations under serious study are those which are used in scientific practice, only counterexample is Norton's weird things)\n\n- Is the existence mismatch per se indirect?\n****** Existence mismatch\nProblematic indirect infinite idealization where the promotion fails because the infinite(simal) limit system does not exist, while we can imagine a property of such a system.\n+ Examples\n  - Ever increasing spheres. We can imagine that the surface/volume ratio of an infinite sphere is 1/r, but an infinite sphere does not exist\n  - FQHE: 2D electrons do not exist\n  - TDL: there are no infinite molecules, nor are molecules infinitely small\n  - AB effect: there are no infinite solenoids\n  - Population drift: there are no infinite populations\n\n+ Problems\n  - It is difficult to see what exactly \"the limit system does not exist\" means. Norton was relatively clear on that, but other authors have been less clear.\n******* Contradiction in terms (analytic)\nHere the problem arises because an infinitely small or big process/entity/model cannot exist per the definition of the thing. A sphere is defined by the equidistant points from a center, but points infinitely far away cannot meaningfully be said to be equidistant. Or points infinitely far away aren't points? Whatever.\n\nThis requires us to be quite strict with our definitions, something which physical models rarely are.\n******* Contradiction somewhere else, usually physical (synthetic)\n\nHere the problem arises not because the stipulated entity could not be imagined with a property set to zero or infinity, but because this would contradict something else. I feel like most problems discussed of actual idealizations used in physics are of this kind, as they seem to contradict something uncontrovertible.\n\nAs cite:Shech2013 points out, for this to work you also need to stipulate that the idealization is real in some sense in order to force a strong contradiction. One way to do this is by using an indispensability argument.\n\n+ Examples\n  - FQHE: problem is that actual electrons are not 2D\n  - AB: problem is that actual solenoids are not infinite\n  - TDL: problem is that actual systems do not contain infinite amounts of molecules\n  - Population drift: problem is that actual populations cannot be infinite, because too many?\n\nIf feel like we can distinguish /even further/ here, namely between idealizations which set a value to infinity vs those that set a value to zero. Maybe this is a higher category, but I feel like the ones that set stuff to zero could have a chance of not being physically problematic, because we can imagine that property not being there. That would then be either above or below existence mismatch, or above problematic maybe. However this would just move the categorty of problematic lower.\n\nBut, some things can get set to zero and cause a problem, such as FQHE where 3D dimension is set to zero. So then it would be indirect->zero -> nonproblem/problem -> existence mismatch whatever\n****** Discontinuous limit\nProblematic indirect infinite idealization where the promotion fails because the infinite limit does make sense (in some way) but that there is a dicontinuous jump in the property that is indirectly affected\n+ Examples\n  - Longer and longer ellipsoid becomes an infinitely long cylinder, but an infinitely long cylinder has a different surface to volume ratio than any of the ellipsoids.\n  - Thermodynamic heat transfer/reversible process.\n    A reversible process is an idealization of an infinitely slow process such that the system stays in equilibrium all the time. As the \"heat transfer time interval\" goes to zero all is well, but at 0 no heat can be transfered. Here an arbitrarily slow process works, but an infinitely slow one does not.\n"}],"additions":1,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210204155921-if_you_cant_loop_back_to_your_introduction_make_shit_up_in_your_conclusion.org","oid":"820db8fa7a774806dbbbb01101c139ee6029cc3f","diff":[{"count":83,"value":"#+title: if you cant loop back to your introduction, make shit up in your conclusion\n#+roam_tags: writing thesis\n\n* Context\n\nHad a chat with Guido and Ronnie about my thesis, where we discussed my introduction ([[file:"},{"count":5,"removed":true,"value":"20210105133041-proselike_introduction_v1-archfaceThomas"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"Introduction"},{"count":323,"value":".org][Proselike introduction v1]]).

In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named \"anyons\".\n\nA particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.\n\n** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space\n\nHow do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?\nWe have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.\n\nAs mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.\n\nUsing the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.\n\n** Naive exchange\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):\n\nWe start out with a wavefunction $\\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_1\\psi_2\\]\n\nIf we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [[file:20210210115635-phase_transitions.org][phase transitions]]\n\n\\[\\Psi_\\pi=e^{i\\theta\\pi}\\psi_2\\psi_1\\]\n\nExchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with\n\n\\[\\Psi_{2\\pi}=e^{i2\\pi\\theta}\\Psi_0\\]\n\nTherefore, $e^{i2\\pi\\theta}=1 \\rightarrow e^{i\\pi\\theta}=\\pm 1$, which leads to $\\theta=0 \\lor \\theta=1$.\n\nWe have therefore \"shown\" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\\theta=0$) and fermions ($\\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.\n\n** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not \"the operator framework\" )\n\nWhat we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.\n\n(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)\n\nThe three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation\n\n\\begin{equation}\n[S_i,S_j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K\n    \\label{eq:spincomm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nIf we take the state $\\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^2\\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:spinsquared}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\nS_3\\ket{s,m}=m\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:s3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nthen we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^+\\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\\ket{s,m+1}=\\ket{s,m'}\n    \\label{eq:splus}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf we require $\\sqrt{|\\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\ns(s+1)-m(m+1)\\geq0 \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:posnorm}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq s \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:ms}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIt is clear then, that for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so\n\\begin{equation}\ns-m= n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:int}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimilarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s=n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:mpluss}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining \\eqref{eq:int} and \\eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s+s-m=2s=n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow s=\\frac{n}{2}\n    \\label{eq:proofofinteger}\n\\end{equation}\nSince $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.\n\nSo, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.\n\n*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng\n\n*** TODO Spin statistics relation\n\n\n** Configuration space framework\n\nThe above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.\n\nLuckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows\n\n1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles\n2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space\n3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange\n\nIt almost seems too easy.\n\nLet's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).\n\nWithout any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^d \\"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"otimes"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"times"},{"count":562,"value":" \\mathbb{R}^d\\]\n\nHowever, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.\n\n\n\nWe need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )\n\nLet us call the set of diagonal points $\\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\\mathbf{r}=(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})$.\n\n\nThen, for our configuration space looks like\n\\begin{equation}\n"},{"count":3,"added":true,"value":"Q= "},{"count":9,"value":"\\mathbb{R}^d \\"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"otimes"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"times"},{"count":38,"value":" \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d  - \\Delta }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:confspaceddim}\n\\end{equation}\n\n"},{"count":2,"added":true,"value":"# "},{"count":1610,"value":"=just blantantly copied=\nIn order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can \"discard\" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in\n\\begin{equation}\nS=\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d -\\Delta}{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:S}\n\\end{equation}\n\nBefore showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....\n\n*** 3D\nLet's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\\Delta$, which for $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1 -\\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).\n\n[[./media/3dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\n\n=Copying again=\n\nAn exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be \"looping it around\" the sphere (path C).\n\nWhat is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.\n\nNow we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha^2=+1 \\rightarrow \\alpha = \\pm 1\n    \\label{eq:doubleexchange}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.\n\n\n*** 2D\n\nLet us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.\n\n[[./media/2dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 2D exchange\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\nWe make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.\n\nHowever, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the \"string\" cannot collapse to single point in principle.\n\nTherefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\\alpha$ has no effect on $|\\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}\n    \\label{eq:phasephase}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n*** Connection to the Braid group\n\nThe above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way? The answer lies in a theorem????\n\nQuantum statistics of a particle are the 1D representation of the [[file:20210403175440-first_homotopy_group_pi_1.org][First homotopy group pi_1]]/[[file:20210218153905-fundamental_group.org][fundamental group]] of the configuration space.\n\n"},{"count":2,"added":true,"value":"# "},{"count":1620,"value":"(Why are the QS that? Is this a theorem? If so, when does it apply?)\n\n\n\n*** The relation between phase and connectedness of a space\n\n\nFor $d=2$ the fundamental group is the Braid group.\n\nThe 1D rep of the braid group is $e^{i\\theta} \\quad \\theta\\in[0,2\\pi]$\n\n\n* Critique\n\nThe main crux of my critique lies in the (in my eyes) unnecessary assumption that the quantum statistics of a particle can /only/ be determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space. While this might work as a prediction, i.e. if we can figure out the configuration space and then the fundamental group, we might reasonably expect to find particles with such and such quantum statistics there.\n\nHowever, I do not find this very satisfactory as an explanation, it feels much too close to a DN way of explaining things, which, as we know [[file:20210330165632-problems_with_the_dn_model.org][DN cannot determine whether something is a difference maker]]. That is, the explanation works backwards: instead of ending uncontrovertably with the most controversial point, namely that the configuration space of the anyons is 2D, it arrives there kind of casually.\n\n\n\nThe order of explanation as it is usually given is like this:\n1. We have observed fractional quantum statistics (alledgedly, i'm willing to grant that at this point)\n2. /The quantum statistics of the particle are determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space/\n3. The 1D rep of the Braid group is fractional quantum statistics\n4. The Braid group is the first homotopy group of a non-simply connected 2D configuration space\n5. Therefore particles which exhibit fractional quantum statistics need to have a 2D configuration space\n\n\nNow, if all of the above steps /necessarily/ are /if and only ifs/, this argument is rather water tight. However, I would dispute that this is the case here, first and foremost on the grounds that this conclusion is /primae facie/ unacceptable and a paradox, so something seems to go wrong here. We can either resolve this paradox by correcting our physics to allow for precisely 2D configuration spaces, or, what seems more agreeable to me, by not allowing the argument to reach this conclusion, as I do not believe every single on of the steps above are if and only ifs.\n\nSpecifically, I have trouble with step 2, as we appear to need some theorem in order to establish this but I have not really found such a theorem, just vague gestures to the fact that these statistics come from the worldlines being intertwined and whatnot.\n\nThe other way around the explanation looks a lot less secure\n\n1. The configuration space describing the exchange of two identical particles contains a hole in the origin and is thus non-simply connected\n2. Such a space has an infinite number of homotopy classes of equivalent (i.e. continuously deformable into each other) paths\n3. The fundamental group/first homotopy group of these paths is the Braid group\n4. The 1D rep of this group is $e^{i\\theta}$\n5. /This is the spin of the particles we are interested in/\n\n\n** The problem with treating this as a DN explanation\n\nThe problem with treating this a DN explanation is that that requires that the Laws of Nature used are true and ALSO the events described as premises. However, there are not really any of the latter, as we can't take the existence of a 2D things as a premise, as that is weird.\n\n[[file:20210405144616-eia_allows_us_to_verify_dn_premises.org][EIA allows us to verify DN premises]]\n\n\n* Brief critique summary\n\n** Leng says: \"Platonism is not real, because we can just say that physical space approximately instantiates mathematical structures, so we don't need that exactness\"\n\n** Shech says: \"We cannot use approximate instantiation if we assume approximation means how Norton says it and if we use the EIA.

The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.\n\nInstead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.\n\nWith \"finding an alternative route\", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.\n1. Bob takes anti-conception pills\n2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant\nC. Bob does not become pregnant.\n\nWhile we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with. This idealization might not be as problematic however. (this is later or earlier, haven't figured out where to put it)\n\n=garbo=\nNext, we have an equally unpromising candidate, which is the \"mini-explanation\". The fundamental group of 2D exchange under two particles is the Braid group\nE. The fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of $N$ identical particles in 2D is $B_N$\nL. The quantum statistics of a particle is the 1D rep of the fundamental group of the ...\nC. The quantum statistics of 2D particles are anyonic i.e. $e^{i\\theta}$\n(I'm being loose with the structure here, as otherwise it would be a huge drag to write everything out, i.e. \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of two identical particles is $e^{i\\theta}$\", \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group ... are the quantum statistics\", .... (secretly I don't really know how to write this out DN style as the example laws are always extremely simple conditionals, nor do I really know how to transfer this to theorems rather than laws. If this is a big problem we can discuss this, I think more likely I will have to get rid of the reference to the DN explanation or formulate this differently entirely. Regardless, this is more an example of how I wish to argue))\n=garbo=\n\n...\n\nThe most promising candidate for such an intervention is centered around the fundamental group of the system, but not in the way that the argument is presented by Shech. Instead let us examine how the argument goes once more:\n\nWe see the Quantum Hall Effect manifest\n\n* Checklist\n\nTo show it can be approximated, I need to show that there are /some/ paths which are nondeformable into one another/non collapsible to a point. In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*\n\n** Options\n\n*** Particles have nonzero size\n\nIn these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.\n\n*** Not ALL paths\n\nWhile the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.\n\n\n*** Winding can be something different?\nThe main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210403175539-group.org][Group]]\n\n\n\n\n* Junk\n\nStartingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.\n\nHowever, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one. While I agree the 3D space cannot approximate 2D space if the property under consideration is connectedness as presented, I do think it is possible for some other factor down the argumentative line to be considered \"approximately instantiated\" in the Nortonian sense.\n\nWe just need to find a different path to \"fit in\" to the explanation of the possibility of anyons, i.e. either\n1. 2D space is approximately instatiated in the experiment due to thinness and strong fields, giving rise to something with the same properties as 2D space\n2. Holes are approximately instantiated, for instance ??\n3. Connectedness is approximate, in the sense that we don't care about /all/ paths but just most paths, and we can create a lot of paths which don't work well\n4. Homotopy classes are approximate, in the sense that we don't derive the homotopy classes from the connectedness of the space but from looking at different paths and seeing that they /don't/ act the same way. rather than that they /can't/ act the same way\n5. Fundamental group is approximate, in the sense that we don't look at all the homotopy classes but look at what kind of behavior the elements of the group have\n6. 1D rep is approximate. I don't see how this would work.\n7. Equivalence between spin is approximate, in the sense that there is some other physical mechanism which causes the phase to be such which does not rely on the above, such as the Berry phase calculation.\n\n\nSo, which of these is the most likely canditate for approximate instantiation?\n"}],"additions":12,"deletions":2},{"filepath":"20210403175440-first_homotopy_group_pi_1.org","oid":"34373a2a723b532c49a389ef01c0a1b8eccfa222","diff":[{"count":21,"value":"#+title: First homotopy group pi_1\n#+roam_tags: topology definition\n\n"},{"count":9,"added":true,"value":"* First homotopy group\n\n"},{"count":146,"value":"The first homotopy group $\\pi_1$ of a configuration space is the [[file:20210403175539-group.org][Group]] formed by inequivalent paths passing through a  given point in the configuration space.\nThe elements are the groups are paths (or more precisely, their traversal), with multiplication being defined as traversing two paths succesively, and the inverse being the traversal of the path backwards (identity being the point path).\n"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"\n"}],"additions":5,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210407150939-structure_fqhe_anyon_chapter.org","oid":"a2ab6dfe3b1dbb27cbe78094e1681de99c699a7c","diff":[{"count":31,"value":"#+title: Structure FQHE/anyon chapter\n#+roam_tags: chapter anyons FQHE\n# #+startup: latexpreview\n\n"},{"count":2,"added":true,"value":"# "},{"count":5,"value":"#+latex_header: \\"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"documentclass{tufte-book}\n#+latex_header: \\"},{"count":1451,"value":"usepackage{braket}\n\n* The Fractional quantum hall effect and its discontents\n\n# convince the reader that what you're saying is worthwhile\n\nSo, now that we have gained a high-level idea of idealizations, the question is: which idealizations are worth looking at? We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle.

This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3.

These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n\n\n"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"\n"},{"count":763,"value":"**** Dawdling\nNow that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nInteger is somewhat interesting but only insofar as it allows us to sort of get why the plateuax are there, although this explanation does not really work for the FQHE as it does not take electron interactions into account which are crucial\n#BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  IQHE\n\n\n***  Landaus\n\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223165225-landau_levels_in_an_electric_field.org][Landau levels in an electric field]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223160810-derivation_of_landau_levels_for_qhe.org][derivation of Landau levels for QHE]]\n\n\n***  Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\nImpurities\n\n\n\n\n However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample.

We have neither\na. shown that the fundamental group of $\\tilde{Q}'$ is $B_N$\nb. justified neither condition 1), 2) or 3).\n\n** Fundamental groups\n#+latex: {\\color{red}(I am unsure whether I need to prove this after showing that the space is non-simply connected. These don't follow from each other directly, but since the homotopy classes of both are identical I don't see much need to illustrate this in much detail})\n\nA rigorous derivation of the fundamental group of these spaces is highly non-trivial (see for instance cite:Fox1962 for the derivation of the 2D case). I will instead do the normal philospher of physics thing, namely to gesture at a proof which I belief will probably hold.\n\nThe only thing we need to show is that the $3D$ case is not different in any relevant  respect to the $2D$ one. In case of the fundamental group, the relevant respect is the number of [[file:20210427162825-homotopy_equivalent_paths.org][Homotopy equivalent paths]], the classes of paths which cannot be continuously deformed into one another. In a non-simply connected space, a path which winds around a \"hole\" cannot continuously be deformed into one which does not, nor can a path which winds around said hole twice be deformed into one that only winds around it once, or winds around it twice clockwise.\n\nLuckily for us, the  homotopy equivalent paths of  $\\tilde{Q}'$ are the same as those for $\\tilde{Q}$ , as all the paths that wind around the \"origin-hole\"  $k$ times can be continuously deformed into one another in both cases, and no other winding-sites exist. If our space would have additional holes, that could pose a problem, but for now we can rest easy.\n\nThus, since the number of homotopy classes is the same, the fundamental group is also identical, namely $B_N$ for $N$ particles. Therefore the $1D$ rep will remain the same, and the particles will not be limited to a phase of $0$  or $1$, and therefore anyons are possible.\n\n\n** Justifying the conditions\nWhile I will give some justification below, let us consider one line of argument: since (presumably) the configuration space just constructed allows for the existence of anyons, why do we not simply discard our previous idealization and insert this one into the EIA? Sure, it has some quirks, but the condition that particles cannot come within a certain distance of one another is hardly more problematic than assuming the particles cannot move in an entire dimension. The additional criterion of the wavefunction being zero outside the QH system similarly appears less restrictive than the 2D idealization. Can we then just assume that this is a strictly better model to use?\n\nUnfortunately, not quite. While assumptions 1. and 2. might be brushed off in this way, accepting 3. without further justification @@latex: \\yellow{is not nice} @@. Unlike the /2D/ idealization, performing an inference to the best explanation also does not appear quite satisfactory, as the condition is so specific that unjustified acceptance makes it ~too ad hoc~.\n\n*(My idea for justifying this was to find a way to express the probability of finding the particle in the z direction and contrast that with the Coulomb force, but I wasn't able to find the former. Shech cites a $10^{-45}$  probability for it, but he doesn't justify or cite it. In the end it does not really matter as this is just a proof of concept, but would be nice to have)*\n\n# The AB effect also has such a strong idealization. Underscription of idealizations.\n\n* Footnotes\n[fn:2] It's /2 in order to have the origin be set at zero.\n\n[fn:1] Unless further argued for, this statement is technically begging the question, as the Pauli-exclusion principle is a consequence of the phases being a certain way and probably should not be assumed. There exist less ad-hoc ways of formalizing this constraint, which, however, do often rely on specific interpretations of quantum mechanics, see for instance cite:Brown1999.\n"}],"additions":1308,"deletions":249},{"filepath":"inbox.org","oid":"ed1d4710e194739451a53d3a3f6f3f3dbca5ff9b","diff":[{"count":97,"value":"#+title: inbox\n#+STARTUP: overview logrefile content showstars indent\n#+FILETAGS: inbox esn thesis jote emacs home adhd notes customization\n#+TODO: NEXT TODO PROJ WAIT | DONE CANCELED TRASH\n\n#+begin_comment\nThis is the inbox.

This is not a new thought, but one I wish to explore in this thesis.\n\n** Specifically: words seem to denote a very precise ontological thing, but our epistemological capacities arent that precise\n\nI believe there exists a massive mismatch between the way we use language (names and/or concepts in particular) and how we conceptualize the ontology of the world. In short it is this: the _names_ we use for objects and _concepts_ in our language are discrete, while the space underlying them is continuous. That is, while we use names and concepts as if they have a definite _boundary_, there does not seem to be a clear line we can draw between the object and not-object, the concept and not-concept. Their boundary seems to be _vague_, indeterminate, fuzzy, etc.\n\n(this is not really a good example, I could start with \"human\" or \"the human that X\" or something. It's a much more familiar and vivid example, but it does veer into philosophy of biology more easily, so I'm weary to use it as a starting off point. Ideally I'd use a physics example but I don't have one that's quite so vidid as \"human\")\nNames and the objects they refer to are discrete in the way that one definite signifier is intented to represent one definite object or kind of object (natural kinds, I think): it is implied that the name refers to something with a definite spatio-temporal boundary. The problem of vagueness arises from the contrast between this proposed definiteness of boundary with the actual continuity of space, which does not lend itself to having distinct, point-like boundaries. In some cases this is more apparent than others. Take the name \"the football used in the 2016 world cup finals\" and the object it refers to, the actual football. The name implies, by use of \"the\", that there is one unique object, the actual football, it describes.\n\nAt first glance this appears uncontroversial: there is only one football which was used during the final, no exchanges were made and no \"multi-ball\" rule was suddenly introduced. The issue however is that we do not believe that footballs are fundamental constituents of reality, were there to be such things as fundamental consituents of reality. Instead we think that footballs are composed of smaller objects which may be fundamental consituents of reality, such as molecules, atoms, protons, quarks, and so forth. This fact leads to there not being a one to one mapping between the name \"the football used in the 2016 World Cup finals\" and a definite set of fundamental consituents of reality in a number of ways.\n\nThe first is a basic line drawing problem. This problem in fact already presents itself without thinking of the football as being composed of smaller consituents, as it is a consequence of the presumed continuity of space. It is not possible to pinpoint the exact location where the ball begins and ends, simply because it is not possible to measure a real number.\n\nThe second is due to specific physical theories: because of the uncertainty principle, there simply is no fact of the matter where the final electron belonging to the football and not to not-the-football is located in space, except of the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which is not per se popular.\n\nThe third and final issue with delineating the football is a more familiar matter: our idea of \"the football\" is not so fine-grained as to allow for the minute differences that happen to the football over the course of even a second. Kicking the football will result in some molecules separating from the main clump, perhaps adding some from the dirt, some of its atoms will decay, it will radiate away some heat and absorb some more: the exact state of the football changes across its life, second to second, moment to moment.\n\nThis third problem is best conceptualized using the Sorites paradox, which is not specific to names but to properties and concepts more generally as well. The basic idea can be summarized as follows: ten thousand grains of rice makes a heap of rice (or X collection of atoms make up \"the football\"). 9.999 grains of rice still make up a heap, as does 9,998. It appears that if N grains of rice make up a heap, then N-1 grains of rice also make up a heap. However, by mathematical induction, this would force us to conclude that any x grains of rice makes up a heap, including 1 grain of rice, which is patently false. To combat this, we can postulate that there exists a definite boundary between \"being a heap\" and \"not being a heap\". However, since the only way in which we can affect the heap is by adding or subtracting a grain of rice, this would lead to the other false conclusion that there exists an x such that X grains of rice do not make a heap while X+1 grains of rice do make a heap, which goes against the premises of the first argument: a true paradox.\n\n** I don't want to directly tackly meaning/vagueness/boundaries because it's hard. Instead I will look at physics because I know physics, and they sort of do this\n\nThese problems are deep and substantial, and while tackling them head on might be an option, I instead wish take a more roundabout route for exploring them by relating them to an area that explicitly deals with making precise denotations of an continuous mess: physics.\n\n** Physical Models/Idealization\n\nI take it as uncontroversial that physicists construct models, such as the Standard Model of Particle Physics, with a goal being to, at the very least, at some point make predictions about the outcomes of experiments. I furthermore take physics to be that what physicists do. Therefore one of the goals of physics is to construct models which make accurate predictions about the outcomes of experiments. This is a very conservative picture of physics.\n\n** Physics is a good case study as they use models which are analogous to the thing im interested in\n\nThe link between physics and the way words represent concepts becomes more clear when taking a slightly more ambitious stance towards the enterprise of physics, namely as constructing models which, in one or more aspects, _represent the world_. Representing an aspect of the world through a model is analogous to representing an object by a name, or more generally a concept by a word: continuous nature is fit into rigid molds. Investigating this link, therefore, might show us something about language more generally.\n\n** Too difficult on its own, let's just look at idealizations or abstractions\n\nHowever, attempting to evaluate how, if at all, physics represents \"reality\" directly proves no less difficult than attempting to determine that for words, concepts, objects, natural kinds etc. in general. Here, too, we need to narrow our scope to attack this question in any sensible way. I propose that the relevant aspect of physical modelling lies in its employment of idealizations and abstractions in order to simplify the mess that is continuous reality.\n\nAlthough the nature of idealizations and abstractions (henceforth I will just write idealization) will be spelled out in more detail later, it is worth noting some of its basic features and some similarities with the larger issue of denotation.\n\n\n(For the moment I will treat idealizations and abstractions as basically being the same thing, idealizations probably being more specific than abstractions. It is important and necessary to determine whether these do amount to the same thing however, see for instance cite:Shapiro2004, cite:mancosuAbstractionInfinity2016, cite:Lutz or cite:Knox2016 or cite:2016\nAlthough one clear difference does already spring to mind: idealizations are usually strictly false, while abstractions are more akin to generalizations, in that they are not false but simply cover more phenomena. Idealizations might not be a subtype of abstraction, but maybe a feature of it. I might start by introducing abstractions first, then focusing on idealizations later as a way to tackle that, but I am not sure of that step yet.)\n\n** Why should we pick idealizations\n\n   The solution is to pick specific aspects of a model that get close to the problem at hand. To this end I suggest using the idea of an \"idealization\", as idealizations are somewhat analogous to what I see as discreitziation, and are an import component of models. One of the key tasks will be to first flesh out the concept of an idealization, how necessary they are to models and how the relate to discretization. This will be done in chapter [[file:../../.local/share/Trash/files/20210106131334-chapter_idealizations_meta.org][Chapter Idealizations (meta)]]. I will specifically have a look at a subclass of idealizations: infinite or infinitesimal idealizations. This is because I believe they highlight what goes wrong with idealizations more clearly in a way that mirrors the general problem of discretization.\n\n** TODO Why Infinite idealizations\n*** Actual reason: (Shech makes this literal argument)\n*** What is an infinite idealization\n\nAn infinite idealization is an idealization in which some relevant property is set to 0 or infinity, rather than approximating it as being arbitrarily small or large.\n\n*** How does it differ from a normal idealization\n\nInfinite idealizations differ from \"normal\" or simple idealizations, to borrow cite:Strevens2019a 's terminology, in which a value is simply set to some other value.\n\n*** What's the goal of an infinite idealization\n\nFirst we must separate what an infinite idealization does from what it is meant to do.\n\n*** Infinite idealizations lead to problems\n**** Limit system does not exist\n**** Limit system disagrees with actual system\n** EIA\n*** Physical models and their idealizations are only a good case study if they are claimed to represent trutfully/literally\n\nThe relation between idealizations/abstractions and aspects of the world does not prove to be such a direct candidate for comparison between names and objects so easily, as there exists an important difference between the rough picture of physics sketched above and the question of how to match the discrete objects to continuous \"name space\": the models of physics do not per se truthfully represent the world, at least not until we stipulate such a thing. In contrast, when talking about the problem of discrete names not matching their continuous objects, the problem only arises when we imagine the word to truthfully represent the object, or, less strongly, to factor into true propositions about that object e.g. \"the football is round\". Similarly, models can only be used to study the boundary problem if we stipulate that the truthfully represent the world in some relevant aspect. (the relevant aspect quantifier is there because we do not expect our current models to grasp every relevant structure of the world, e.g. no emperically backed theory of quantum gravity exists as of yet.)\n\n*** Scientific realism claims that the idealizations truthfully represent\n\nFortunately, a rich philosophical tradition exists which espouses just the view that physical models truthfully represent, at least in some respect, the world: scientific realism. This tradition is no monolith however, and many competing and often incompatible interpretations exist, some more modest than others. More conservative, modern takes on the subject such as the structuralist realism espoused by James Ladyman and John Ross, are not easily said to believe that physical theories \"represent\" some relevant aspect of the world, rather they claim that such models \"latch on\" to relevant structures of the world, whatever they may be.\n\n*** The EIA as a case study/representative of scientific realism\n\nFor the purposes at hand, namely to elucidate how, if at all, the continuum can be discretized, it is more instructive to at least initially turn our gaze to stronger, more bold variations on scientific realism. The strongest seriously discussed version of scientific realism are based on Putnam-Quine style indispensability arguments, the \"naive\" version of which goes as follows:\n\n**** \"Naive\" Indispensability Argument\n\n    1. We ought to believe in the existence of those entities which are indispensable to our best scientific theories.\n    2. X is indispensable to our best scientific theories\n    C. We ought to believe in the existence of X\n\n   The \"naive\" is put in scare quotes here because this version of the indispensability argument has (more than) one shortcoming, in it leaving unclear what being indispensable to a scientific theory entails. What is it to be dispensable to a theory? To solve this, the modern form of the argument, the \"Enhanced Indispensability Argument\" (EIA), is used instead, which goes as follows:\n\n**** Enhanced Indispensability Argument (EIA)\n\n   P1. We ought to believe in the existence of those entities which are indispensable to our best scientific explanations\n   P2. X is indispensable to our best scientific explanations\n   C. We ought to believe in the existence of X\n\nThe focus has now shifted from indispensability for our best scientific theories to explanations in stead. This move is motivated by two thoughts. For one, it assumes that to succeed as a scientific theory is to offer a good explanation, or at the very least that providing a good explanation is good enough grounds to believe in its existence, provided that being indispensable to our best scientific theories is more than sufficient already. That is, offering good explanations is a necessary condition for being a good theory, as we do not think a theory succeeds without it. It is close to being a sufficient condition for constituting a good scientific theory as well, but I am hesitant to claim so on the grounds that what consitutes a \"good\" explanation is rather contentiuous, as we shall see, and that the number of phenomena a theory can explain does seem to matter as well. I do not believe that an extremely specific theory which somehow makes little to no reference to existing theories and is able to explain a single phenomenon well would count as a succesful one (although it might be argued that calling this an explanation would be questionable, but I digress).\n\nSecond, it carries with it the hope that \"being indispensable to explanation\" is easier to clarify than \"indispensability to a theory.\" This second thought requires one to buy that a) scientific explanation can be satisfactorily defined and delineated from not-\"scientific explanations\", which includes both non-explanations and non-scientific explanations (henceforth with \"explanation\" I will mean \"scientific explanation\" unless otherwise specified). Furthemore, it requires us to find plausible that b) finding that which is indispensable for those explanations is more straightforward than for theories as a whole. I will not grant these moves immediately and will scrutinize them in what's to come.\n\n*** What can the truth or falsity of the EIA possibly lead to\n\nBefore saying why looking at the Putnam-Quine argument could provide us insight on the much more general problem of discretization, let us first evaluate what sort of conclusions we could draw from our investigation. To start, let us say that thoroughly examining the Putnam-Quine argument leads us to consider it a valid form of inference to the actual consituents of the world, and furthermore we find entities or other things for which the argument holds. Our quest would then be complete, as we have found a way to justify dividing up the continuum of space and time (or \"thought space\" in the case of mathematical objects) into discrete, consituent parts (given that the entities which enter in the argument are discrete, which I will argue later they are). This provides a sufficient answer to the \"if at all\" part, and sheds some light on the \"how\" part, though does not exhaust the possibilities. For instance, it would provide little clarity on how, if at all, we do so in ordinary language when talking about footballs and tables, except if we take the EIA to be an exhaustive guide to all actual entities, something which the argument cannot entail in its form stated above.\n\n*** If we were to find that (infinite) idealizations do not factor into the EIA, why is it useful for the main problem of \"discretization\"\n\nAs the reader might have expected, I am not so optimistic about the EIA's chances of meeting the demands to be spelled out. How, then, would investigating it yield us any fruitful information about discretization? For if the EIA does not turn out to be a valid form of inference for determining the discrete parts of reality, it would not rule out the possibility of doing so, much less show us why it is impossible in the first place. In particular, the EIA provides a sufficient condition for something to have ontological status, not a necessary one. Therefore failing to be indispensable to explanation does preclude any entity/structure from having ontological status. (Is this true? Is the EIA not \"those and only those\"?)\nThis concern is real and valid. In fact, finding that the EIA is not valid would not rule out anything about the discretization on its own. Instead, the EIA provides a case study in which to more concretely tackle an instance of this problem, and my hope is that by examing its workings applied to specific examples to be expounded upon below, we might learn something valuable about the more general problem in the process. Given the scope and generality of the issue, it would be extremely optimistic to hope to solve it in a lifetime, much less one thesis, so my aims are more humble: to extract from the EIA some valuable lessons for tackling the discretization problem (or whatever you want to call it.)\n\n*** Why it's worth looking at idealization at the EIA (again)\n\nAs mentioned previously, we seem to have lost the \"how\" in the \"how, if at all\" formulation of the main question in the step of attempting to apply the EIA to idealizations. One argument in favor of this step is that it is a necessary condition for explaining \"how\" something works, /that/ it works at all first. Additionally, the hope is that by showing \"how not\" the EIA, we learn something about \"how not\" to answer the question of discreteness. While the possibilities for discretization are technically endless, humans only need a finite number of counterexamples in order to be dissuaded of the usefulness of something. This rather severe limitation might then be a better starting point: to provide reason for distrusting discretization of continua, rather than providing a direct counterargument. If a direct counterargument comes up, so much the better. If we end up concluding that (infinite) idealizations cannot factor into the EIA, at least we have something.\n\n*** Two ways of evaluating the EIA: P1 and P2\n\nIn order for the EIA to be a sound argument, its premises must entail its conclusion and its premises need to be true. The argumentative structure of the EIA is as straightforward as it gets, so it is valid. The premises, however, are controversial to say the least. Therefore the soundness of the EIA hinges on the acceptance of its premises, meaning that there are two ways the EIA could fail: either it is not true that we ought to believe in those entities that are indispensable to our best scientific explanations, or the relevant entity X is not indispensable for our best scientific theories. Let us say something about each of these in turn.\n\n**** What does arguing against premise 1 give us\n\nRegarding permise 1, arguing against the premise that we ought to believe in those entities that are indispensable for our best scientific theories is arguably the strongest move one could make, as it prevents the argument from taking off at all. Such a line of argument is common among anti-realists.\n\n**** Why not to tackle premise 1\n\nHowever, I would prefer not to take this line of argument for two reasons. For one, I feel it is not so convincing to the putative realist. Many convincing anti-realist arguments have already been made by van Fraassen etc, so I find it unlikely I would be able to sway a realist by making such an argument. Secondly, a succesful argument against premise 1. would take the form of one of the following:\na) argue against explanations, either playing a (crucial) role in forming our explanations or the possibility of explanations in general\nb) argue against indispensability as a criterion for belief in entities\nc) argue against believing in entities, whether some specific entities or entities in general.\n\na) and b) would not entail much at all about the discretization question, while an argument for c) could instead directly be used as an argument for the main problem or again not entail much, as \"we ought not to believe in the existence of entity X\" would simply remove X from the list of things to consider demarcatably, while \"we ought not to beleve in any entity X (which has certain general properties)\" could be reformed as \"we are not able to demarcate discrete objects with property X\", which defeats the point of using the EIA at all.\n\n**** We should look into premise 2 instead\n\n   Therefore, I wish to focus on premise 2: X is indispensable to our best scientific theories. One might immediately object that this is subject to the same charges as before, namely that looking at some class of objects X, say electrons, will likely not entail much about the conclusion in general. The way around this is to pick our X carefully. A candidate could be models in general, as finding out that models are not indispensable would make us not have to believe in them, and if models are analogous to concepts in the sense that they discretize a messy continuum, this might show us something about how this is done in general. However, this is too broad a task, as (almost) all physical explanation concerns models and what consitutes a model is (ironically) difficult to define. This is then subject to the same charge as that for denying explanation outright, or just impossible.\n\n*** Why not use this for premise 1 tho\n\nBut why can we not pick infinite idealizations for conclusion 1 instead, i.e. argue whether or not we ought to believe in the \"existence\" of infinite idealizations if they are necessary for our best scientific explanations, rather than evaluating whether they are in fact dispensable or not? Good question. I believe that arguing against the conditional, be that by denying the consequent or the antecedent, is getting ahead of ourselves. It makes the thing not so useful.\n\n*** TODO MORE TEXT JUSTIFYING WHY IM TACKLING THE EIA ON ITS SECOND PREMISE GOES HERE\n* On explanation\n\nBefore evaluating the indispensablity of certain entities/whatever to the purported explanation of physical phenomena, we need to come to an agreement how, if at all, these explanations explain.\n\nThe stance Shech takes to explanation is a sociological (?) one: explanations are what scientists call explanations. According to Shech, it is not the role of the philosopher to dictate what are good or bad explanations, to say what is good or bad science. \"If one's favorite account of explanation does not account for the standard story [of explaining the FQHE], so much the worse for one's favorite account of explanation\", he says determinately.\n\nI am have two conflicting thoughts on the subject.\n\nOn the one hand, I agree that judging a purported explanation only by reference to \"the\" correct account of explanation is unwise. The decades long debate on explanation has yielded little in the way of consensus about the correct account of explanation, even by the low bar of what is considered consesus in philosophy. Even the deductive nomological account, while seen by many as fatally flawed by not being able to account for the assymetric nature of explanation or being able to distinguish explanatory relevant factors from explanatorily irrelevant ones, is still the most commonl way of explicating explanation, usually prefaced with a half-hearted acknowledgment that is indeed flawed and that these half-hearted apologetics for using it anyway are a cliche in themselves. Other accounts, such as the unificationist account by Kitcher and that other guy, the plethora of causal mechanical models, the interventionist account, mechanistic ones etc, while not enjoying the widespread adoption of the DN model, are still being argued over, with nothing close to a definitive distancing from any of them being the case.\n\nTherefore, arguing the wrongness of an explanation based on it not fitting a certain model of explanation is not particularly convincing for two reasons. One, it requires one to first convince the reader that this account of explanation is the correct one (just trust me), which as seen above, does not seem particularly likely. Secondly, ??\n\nOn the other hand, however, I do not wish to simply do away with any sort of measure of explanatoriness (definitely a word) and to uncritically accept the explanations offered by scientists.\n\nCould lead us to accept bad explanations. Supersymmetry?\n\nHow do we know when the scientific community has accepted something?\n\nTreating the word of scientists as gospel like this does a disservice to them, as it sort of presumes scientists don't and moreover cant set critiria for what is a good explanation.\n\nThis division between philosophy and science seems kind of weird.\n\nWe might be able to identify some common criteria of those things we consider good explanations. For instance, we do not have strongly believe that super symmetry is a good exlpanation for (INSERT WHAT SUPER SYMMETRY EXPLAINS) anymore. Do we believe this simply because physicists have moved on or because there are good reasons for not believing its explanatory capabilities? The latter of course, empirical adequacy is a very important one, which is also a reason we don't consider most of the claims of string theory as explanatory correct.\n\n\nHowever, we must be weary of not simpy defining another concept of explanation. Instead, there are two ways of evaluating the question \"how, if at all, does theory/argument/... X explain phenomenon Y\"?\n\n1. Evaluate whether for every theory of explanation the theory explains. This is the most comprehensive way of tackling the question, and can lead to two answers, only the latter of which is really satisfying\n   a) theory X explains phenomenon Y on accounts of theory of explanation A, B, and C, but not on account of D, E, etc. Therefore, if one believes theories A, B, or C to be the correct theory of explanation, the X explains Y.\n      The problem with this is that either one ends up arguing for the validity of A B or C, which as discussed is dubious or simply leaves it up for the reader to decide for themselves if they believe A B or C, which lacks quite some argumentative force.\n   b) according to all common theories of explanation A, B, ... X does/does not explain Y. Therefore it is plausible to assume X does/does not explain Y, as every theory agrees on the subject.\n   Not only is this quite the amount of work, it is unlikely that we would reach such unanymous agreement, as some theories have widely varying criteria for explanation. Consider for isntance the differnce between causal mechanical and unifying explanations for instance: the former requires an account of how the phenomenon comes to be from the fundamental constituents of the thing and can decide per explanation whether it explains or not, while the latter only requires an explanation to group some set of phenomenon and is not able to say of an individual explanation whether it is \"good\" or not (as most explanations will probably unifity ~some~ phenomena), only whether one explanation is better than another. Comparing the question \"account X constitutes as a good explanation for Y\" (as we are interested in our \"best\" scientific explanations, whatever that may mean) for both the unficationist and the causal mechanical model will therefore prove quite challenging, as a good causal mechanical explanation is just a causal mechanical explanation, while the \"goodness\" of a unificationist explanation is much more graded.\n\n   These are just some of the challenges that come to mind, but again I deem it unlikely unanymous agreement unlikely in the first place, let alone satisfactorily determining whether every explanation is adequate. Does the thermodynamic limit prove a good explanation under all these accounts? Causal mechanical it is certainly doubtful, although some have argued otherwise, see Strevens.\n\n2. Determine some shared criteria all accounts of explanation (should) obey, and evaluate whether these explanations match these criteria.\n\n   This method has two pitfalls\n\n   a) If they obey all of the criteria, this does not mean that it is a successful explanation per se. The criteria only serve a negative purpose, barring would be explanations from attaining such status, as it provides only necessary conditions, no sufficient ones, by design.\n\n   b) Being arbitrarily normative, or rather begging the question\n      If one were to define exclusion criteria for what ought to count as explanation, we need to watch out that we do not beg the question. We must take great care to justify these exclusion criteria, otherwise it can come across as us simply taking elements from these explanations and labeling them as bad. Furthermore the risk exists of excluding an entire category of explanatory theories, which defeats the point.\n\n      (This might happen for instance when one assumes that a good explanation ought to determine which objects in said explanation \"make a difference\", see e.g. cite:DeBianchi2016 )\n\n**** TODO Figure out whether the difference maker discussion excludes the DN model or unificationist model\n*** Goal of the explanation strategy\n\nIn short, the goal in this section is to identify exclusion criteria for explanations that do not\n  a) have arbitrary justification\n  b) exclude an entire theory of explanation\n  c) postulate a new theory of explanation, i.e. be a sufficient condition for explaining.\n     I am not exactly sure what this would look like, but I have one criterion that looks like this\n\n*** Another objection\n\nHow /can/ you identify such criteria? What source of \"explanation\" are you drawing from? The platonic ideal of explanation?\n\nThis is a valid point, but one I can't really answer right now, maybe I'll have a smart reply later.\n\n*** The criteria\n**** TODO A lot. This will form the very foundation of my thesis, while being the most specific part. In order to give a better account here I need to look into the specific phenomena more deeply. What would I gain from that? I feel like I can formulate that to make sense somehow. Self-consistency? Is that different than non-contradiction? It's more of a given,\n**** 1. To warm up, let us begin by defining the most basic criteria any explanation ought to satisfy: it needs to account for the actual empirical thing, save the phenomena as we are fond of saying.\n\n   - Is this part of explanation or of a theory?\n\n**** 2. It needs to follow some sort of \"because\" clause.\n\n   - Very general\n\n**** 3. ...\n**** 4. ...\n**** 5. It needs to create /understanding/ in some agent.\n\n   This might the most crucial one and the most difficult to define. It does hinge on the question: do explanations exist independently of agents to understand them?\n   While this is a difficult question to answer, we need not do so here, provided that it satisfies our earlier defined points, namely is it arbitrary, does it exclude an entire theory of explanation or does it postulate a new one. Let's treat them in turn\n\n***** Arbitrariness\n\n        I'd say no. While not unobjectionable, it certainly does not seem arbitrary or begging the question, as for instance a criterion such as \"no infinities allowed\" would be. Discussion s about udnerstanding and its importance for explanation have been held for a long time in otrher gidelds and have more recently come up in philsophy of science.\n        Moreover it is at least pragmatically true that we would not be aware of any explanations that did not probive any\n\n***** Exclude an entire theory of explanation\n\n        While few of the majors actively include understanding, I argue that none would be significantly changed by including the requirement that they provide understanding.\n\n***** Too sufficient\n\n        This is arguably the biggest charge one could levy against this criterion, since \"providing understanding\" in the sense that someone understands a phenomena after hearing something which does that, sounds like it is explained to them. In order for it not to be sufficient, there need to be things missing from any (set of) proposition(s) which provide understanding, which need to be fulfilled in order to be considered an explanation.\n\n        One thing that comes to mind is that the agent /thinks/ it gained understanding, but in actuality the \"explantion\" which did so is false. Conspiracy theories would constitute such a case: our agent might believe that they gained understanding of the increasing number of autism diagnoses by being \"explained\" that if you get vaccinated then you get autism (or become more likely to get autism) and that the number of vaccinations given has increased. However, the first premise here is false. Has the agent then gained understanding of the increased rate of autism diagnoses? Or more importantly, does the \"explanation\" count as an explanation?\n\n        This would not count as an explanation on all counts of explanation.\n        1. DN: requires all premises to be true. Premise 1 is not true. Therefore not an explanation.\n        2. Causal mechanical: there does not appear that a true causal story of vaccines to autism can be told, therefore not true.\n        3. Interventionist: difficult to tell. While for a single individual it might be possible to intervene here, take an individual without autism and give them a vaccine, see if they develop autism. However few would claim that every single vaccine would cause autism, as most of the world would then be on the spectrum. It seems a lot more difficult to intervene in the course of history and not vaccinate everyone and to then compare whether the autism diagnosis rate remains the same. Counterfactual speculation seems difficult here, therefore it does not appear to be a good explanation.\n        4. Unificationist: as mentioned before, for unificationist accounts, \"good\" is relative. However, since we are interested in what our best scientific explanations are, we can compare this explanation of the increasing vaccine rate with a different one and evaluate which one has the greater unifying power. there's probably one right\n\n    So it might not count as an explanation, mostly on the fact that it is not true or better explanations exist. However, does it count as creating understanding?\n\n****** TODO Evaluate whether this counts as understanding\n\n            - Find definition/theories of understanding\n            - Apply them\n\n**** 6. \"It must match reality in some way\"\n\nThis is definitely begging the question man, we are trying to find this very thing remember? The hell does matching reality mean.\n\n**** 7. The explanation must not create a contradiction\n\nDuh. This seems like to banal to even mention, not sure if I can draw some interesting conclusions out of this.\n\nWhat I'm thinking about is the thermodynamic limit implying the existence of infinity particles, or FQHE implying 2D particles. However, I cannot take this as refuting the fact that they are explanations, as this is exactly the point of contention. Furthermore it's not a flat out paradox, as it is at least logically possible that some particles could be 2D, it is just very plausible /prima facie/.\n\n(Ideally after this section I'd have some kind of idea/criteria for what to look for in a good explanation. My worry is that doing this /before/ looking at the actual examples I either miss things or end up defining criteria based on my discussion of the examples later, which messes up the structure. Therefore I am uncertain of the place of a chapter on explanations in the structure)\n\n* Part II: The phenomena\n** Limit explanation of phase transitions\n\nIn thermodynamics, phase transitions (such as water boiling, a magnet losing its magnetization) are represented by a non-analyticity in the relevant thermodynamic function (such as pressure or magnetization).  The issue is that we do not consider thermodynamics to be the final theory of the world, and in particular do not find it sufficiently explanatory. Moreover, we have a theory we consider to be more \"fundamental\" than thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and would like to account for the phenomenon of phase transitions in said theory.\n\nHowever, the issue arises that the only way in which to directly recapture the thermodynamic phase transitions using statistical mechanical tools is by taking the so called \"thermodynamic limit\", in which the number of particles is taken to infinity while the volume of said particles goes to zero, keeping the density constant. This is because the thermodynaic variables needed for describing the phase transition in statistical mechanics are derived from the partition function, which is a sum of analytic functions. In order for the thermodynamic variables to exhibit a phase transition i.e. a non-analyticity, the partition must contain a singularity. The partition function can only do so if either the energy of the particles is 0, which is impossible, or if the sum is infinite. This latter result is not trivial, nor is it straightforwardly a theorem, but it is commonly accepted as such, see Kadanov.\n\nTherefore, in order to account for (to explain?) the phenomenon of phase transitions, it is claimed, the thermodynamic limit must be taken i.e. we need to make an infinite idealization. Moreover, it cannot easily be explained away by interpreting this \"limiting operation\" as an approximation, i.e. as one of simply seeing the the collection of atoms to be arbitrarily large. One cannot approximate a singularity: it is either there or not there. Therefore, only at N=infinity does the singularity present itself, not at any point beforehand.\n\nHowever, some, like Norton, argue that the singularity is approximated in some sense that is useful, as the curve of the graph gets closer and closer to the one at N=infinity as N->infinity. The important point then is which property we consider.\n\n** Aharanov Bohm effect\n\nSomething about a solenoid in a magnetic field, which needs to be infinite in order for the calculation to make sense. Something something Berry shift.\n\n** FQHE\n\nThe classical hall effect is the phenomenon of measuring a transversal voltage when running a current through the long side of a metal plate, because of Lorentz afguiging. More electrons on the right then on the left, thus potential difference thus voltage.\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect has two sub parts: the integer and fractional quantum hall effect. Let us start with the former. The integer quantum hall effect is observed when running a similar experimental setup to the classical hall effect, but with a much thinner and purer sheet. This gives weird plateaus at integer multiples of the quantum of resitance?. The explanation for these plateaus is some weird stuff about Landau levels, but is ultimately not too surprising.\n\nThe Fractional Quantum hall effect is the weirder one. As the name suggests it is similar in appearance to the integer quantum hall effect, the difference being that the plateaus occur at fractional (1/3 etc) values of the quantum of resistance, rather than at the integer levels. This is rather suprising however, as the explanation for the integer hall effect does not allow there to be fractional quanta. Another explanation, then, is needed. The effect only occurs at even thinner and purer sheets as well. One of the two effects requires a not too pure sheet, cannnot rememver which\n\n\nThe relevant point here is that in order for the explanation of the fractional quantum hall effect (and possibly the integer one as well?) to get of the ground, we /need/ to assume that the configuration space of the electrons in the sheet is two dimensional. For the explanation depends on the fact that the fundamental symmetry group of the particles is Bn, not Sn. Bn is the fundamental group of 2D space, and small 3D space does not equal 2D space. This is an important difference and makes this example much clearer than the Thermodynamic Limit, as this is cool.\n\n** Breaking drops\n\nIn his 2005 paper Breaking Drops something something  cite:Batterman2005 argues that the breaking off of a droplet from a dripping faucet is an example of a genuine discontinuity in nature.

Instead, it is sufficient to focus on one necessary feature of idealizations: they /falsely/ represent one or more features of the real world in order to ease calculation or reasoning (are these all the things people do with models? reasoning is pretty broad so should be safe). This mirrors the major issue with boundary drawing/discretization, namely that some boundary is drawn in order to facilitate reasoning about some object or concept, when identifying or justifying that boundary is difficult. The shared difficulty, then, consists in justifying either the use or reality of such simplifications.\n\nHowever, common descripitions/(word) of idealization specifically include the fact that they introduce a /false/ description, which is not something we ought to assume about the boundary drawing problem, as doing so would beg the question. Instead we will take the by now familiar stance of examining /how, if at all/ the use or legitimacy of idealizations is justified, and hopefully extrapolate from there.\n\n*** Characterizations of idealization?\n\nCharacterizations of idealizations are abound in the literature, although few dare claim to provide an exhaustive one. The most discussed are cite:Norton2012 's characterization of idealization as opposed to approximation:\n- Approximation: proposition which sort of describes the target\n- Idealization: model whose properties sort of describe the target\n\nNorton's standard example is a ball falling through the atmosphere. We have an excellent formula for calculating the velocity $v(t)$ starting at $v=t=0$ as\n\\[\nv(t)=\\frac{g}{k}(1-\\exp(-kt))=gt-\\frac{gkt^2}{2}+\\frac{gk^2t^3}{6}-\\ldots\n\\]\nwhere $g$ is the accelaration due to gravity, and $k$ a friction coefficient.\n\nAs any physics student knows, it is often convenient to leave out the influence of air resistance. Setting $k=0$ gives us\n\\[\nv(t)=gt\n\\]\n\nGiven Norton's distinction, we can look at the above formula in two ways, either as an approximation or as an idealization. If we view it as an approximation i.e. a proposition describing the actual system inexactly, we can say that this is a good approximation for the first part of the ball's descent, becoming a worse and worse approximation as the ball continues to fall. We could also view it as an idealization, in which case we view the above equation as representing a (false) model of a ball falling in a vacuum. It is not the description of this model that is false, rather the model (idealization) misrepresents our world in some way, namely by leaving out air.\n\nIn this example the differnce between an approximation and an idealization is simply a point of view: we can freely shift the characterization of the formula as an approximation or idealization. The \"shifting\" Norton calls promotion and demotion respectively. Promotion consists in taking the approximation to describe a new, idealized model, while demotion is extracting one or more inexact propositions from an existing idealization.  I mention this now because it will come in handy later.\n\nOther descriptions are due to cite:Strevens2007, which characterizes idealizations more similarly to how I did above, as deliberate falsifications of reality. Specifically, Strevens conceptualizes idealizations in terms of the operation behind them: setting a parameter to zero, infinity, or some other number.\n\n*** Why do we not consider the target system an idealization? It's also a model\n\n*** Is idealization different than abstraction?\n\n** Not focus on idealizations as a whole but on infinite idealizations\n\nAs is tradition by now, I wish to focus on a subsection of idealizations first in order to get a better grasp on them. Idealization as construed above does not differ that much from a model, indeed Norton even seems to treat them as synonyms. Analyzing models on their own is difficult, and since idealizations are difficult to distinguish from models entirely, analyizing idealizations on their own will in all likelihood also turn out to be difficult. Therefore let us turn to a more problematic example of idealization, one which has more easily identifiable examples: infinite idealizations.\n\nInfinite idealizations (also called \"asymptotic idealizations\" by for instance cite:Strevens2019 or \"asymptotic explanation\" by for instance cite:Batterman2005) are, put crudely, an idealization which is arrived at through some sort of limiting operation, through which a parameter of the original model is made to approach infinity[fn:infinitesimal]. Commonly discussed examples in the literature are the thermodynamic limit (TDL), the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), the Aharanov Bohm effect, infinite population models ....\n\nAs promised, infinite idealizations run into more obvious problems more quickly: in the thermodynamic limit the number of particles goes to infinity, the FQHE posits 2D particles, the AB effect requires an infinitely long solenoid and in order to explain gene distribuitions biologists assume infinite populations. /Prima facie/, the problem appears straightforward: such things do not exist. \"Can you show me an infinitely long solenoid?\", the detractor exclaims. However, why does this appear so problematic? After all, was intentional misrepresentation not the characterizing feature of idealizations? Why is setting air resistance to $0$ less problematic than setting the $z$-axis to $0$?\n\n...\n\n** Characterizations of infinite idealizations\n (This is the important part, where everything before this is more an idea of how I would fit it in the rest of my thesis)\n*** Norton\n\nFirst in cite:Norton2012 and more in depth in cite:Norton2014, Norton describes his unease with so called \"infinite idealizations\". Although never providing a strict definition, we can make an educated guess to one:\n\n*Infinite Idealization (Norton):*\n\nAn infinite idealization is made by performing a limiting operation on an idealized system, taking some parameter (such as length, number, volume) to either zero or infinity. The infinite idealization is the system with the parameter /set/ to zero or infinity. However, sometimes these systems misbehave by either the limit not obtaining or conflicting, which is bad.\n\nThis characterization somewhat goes against the limit of what Norton intends to argue, namely that such infinite idealizations are not idealizations at all, but can only be sensibly understood as /approximations/ as defined above. For \"the essential starting point of the notion of idealization is that we have a consistently describably system, even if it is fictitious.\"cite:Norton2014 pp. 200   However, I am not willing to grant that condition just yet, so for now we will refer to these systems as infinite idealizations.\n\nNorton furthermore distinguishes between well-behaved and ill-behaved idealizations.[fn:well-behaved] Ill-behaved idealizations are infinite idealizations whose limit system (the system with the parameter /set/ to zero or infinity) does not match with target system in some way. This mismatch can take two forms cite:Norton2012 (3.2, 3.3): the limit system might not exist, e.g. an infinite sphere, or the limit system might have a property which conflicts with a property of the target system. For the former, if we define a sphere as all points which are equidistant from some other point, then an infinite sphere does not exist, as there are no points at infinity. ($\\mathbb{R}=(-\\infty, \\infty)$ not tt$[-\\infty,\\infty]$) For the latter, Norton imagines modelling an arbitarily long ellipsoid as an infinite cylinder. While they look similar, the ratio of surface to volume for an ellipsoid is different than that for a cylinder, so the idealization has a fundamental mismatch.\n\nIn short: for Norton infinite idealization simply is the end result of the process of a limiting operation. Furthermore, these idealizations can sometimes be well behaved, and sometimes ill-behaved.\n\n*** Strevens\n\ncite:Strevens2019a defines infinity (or \"asymptotic\" as he likes to call it, we will stick with infinite here) idealizations slightly differently than Norton. Luckily, Strevens does provide a clear definition, which is in contrast to what he calls a \"simple\" idealization, which \"is ahieved by the straightforward operation of setting some parameter or parameters in the model to non-actual values, often zero\". A clear example is the air-resistance coeffient above. At first, he constrast this straightforwardly with infinite idealizations in the Norton sense, as \"in asymptotic idealization, by contrast, a fiction is introduced by taking some sort of limit\". This definition can be taken to be identical with Norton's.\n\nHowever, later on in the paper he adds an additional layer to the definition, (TODO find a good quote for this) namely that infinite idealizations are made when it is not possible to use a simple idealization to directly the relevant property to zero (or infinity). Furthermore, he adds, \"Asymptotic idealization is an interesting proposition, then, only in those cases where a simple substitution cannot be performed, which is to say only in those cases where a veridical model for mathematical reasons falls apart or otherwise behaves badly at the limiting value.\" While Strevens later argues why these interesting cases (Norton's mismatches) /do/ make sense, we do not have to concern us with evaluating that just yet, we simply need to note that Strevens makes the same distinction as Norton here. Then, we can define\n\n*Infinite Idealization (Strevens):*\n\nAn infinite idealization is made by performing a limiting operation on a system, taking some \"extrapolation\" parameter (such as length, number, volume) to either zero or infinity *in order to set some other parameter to zero or infinity.* The infinite idealization is the system with the extrapolation parameter and the relevant paramenter set to either zero or infinity (dont' need to be the same). However, sometimes these systems misbehave, *which is interesting*.\n(bold to highlight differences with Norton)\n\nBatterman also has some definition but it is rather vague.\n\n** Why this is confusing\n\nI am not satisfied with definitions, as they contain too many different relevant pieces of information such as whether they misbehave, how they do the operation and what kind of subset they form of idealizations in general. I believe that the discussion of infinite idealization would be much clearer if we distinguished between the factors that contribute to the problem, as follows.\n\n** A Categorization of Idealization\n\nFocusing on the discussion of infinite idealizations solely, I believe 4 (maybe 5) distinctions can be drawn. I will first present the distinctions, and then show how I believe they are ordered. The goal is to create categories for (infinite) idealizations to facilitate reasoning and argument, since, as we have seen above, Norton and Strevens are not per se arguing over the same definition, even if it is close.\n\n*** Simple vs. Infinite Idealizations\n\nIn Strevens and less explicitly in Norton, the discussion is presented as being about this distinction, but actually concerns a subclass of infinite idealizations we shall discuss below. However, the simple vs. infinite distinction is a useful one, but I will draw it differently than Strevens.\na) /Simple Idealization/.\n    A simple idealization is an idealization in which no limit is taken in order to set the relevant parameter.\nb) /Infinite Idealization/.\n   An infinite idealization is one in which a limit is taken in order to set a parameter.\n\nNote that no reference has been made to whether or not it affects another parameter, or whether the limit operation is succesful. I argue that this is first and foremost the distinction between these idealizations, and that other qualities should be discussed separately. (I am not sure whether idealizations can be split up neatly into two disjoint sets like these (I'm not sure if that can be done at all, see cite:WEBER2010 ), but i'll just treat it like it does)\n\nThis is a distinction based on /method/: /how/ is the idealization achieved? The idealized system might end up the same in some cases, but the operation is the relevant piece.\n\n*** Direct vs. Indirect Idealizations\n\nThis distinction is also due to Strevens, although he does not discuss it separately and makes it co-refering(?) with the first distinction. Direct idealizations, as the name implies, directly alter the relevant parameter e.g. setting air resitance to zero in order to have zero air resistance.  Indirect idealizations on the other hand, alter a parameter in order to alter the actually relevant parameter, e.g. infinite population in order to set genetic drift to zero, or infinite particles in order to achieve a singularity.\n\nThis is a distinction based on /goal/: /what/ should the idealization achieve? Indirect idealizations are sometimes necessary in order to get rid of a pesky parameter. Note that while this is an intention based distinction, in some models the same parameter might be set directly or indirectly. While in Newtonian Mechanics we might set the air resistance to zero directly, in a more complete QFT description of the same situation we have no access to such a parameter.\n\nAlso note that this distinction is not the same as the one between infinite and simple idealizations: as Strevens notes, it is completely in the realm of possibility to directly set a parameter to zero using an infinite limiting operation, \"but you would merely be showing off.\"\n\nAdditionally, only infinite ideazations can be indirect, but not all are.\n\n*** Unproblematic/boring vs. problematic/interesting\n\n(not sure what to call this yet, should be catchy)\nThis distinction is both due to Strevens and Norton, and is what I believe the main distinction we ought to discuss. This distinction is only relevant for *indirect infinite* idealizations, as both Norton and Strevens agree that all direct and simple idealizations provide little puzzlement. Indirect infinite idealizations can be boring i.e. there is no mismatch with the idealized system and the target system (I have no example), or interesting, by creating such a mismatch. All the idealizations under discussion fall under this category.\n\nThis is a distinction based on /result/: /what/ is the idealization like? (Not too sure about this characterization, not very catchy)\n\n*** Absent vs. Contradictory\n\n(also unsure about these names) (other idea self-contradictory and \"external\"-contradictory? extracontradictory?)\nThis distinction is due to Norton, as Strevens does not explicitly distinguish between the two. This distinction only concerns *interesting idealizations*. For absent idealizations, the idealized model system simply cannot exist in its own terms: an infinite sphere does not denote anything. Contradictory idealizations, on the other hand, postulate some property of the model system which conficts with another property we hold to be incontrovertible, or at least uncontroversial. Most of the idealizations under discussion fall under this category: infinite populations are not self contradictory, but they prevent probabilistic reasoning using uniform distributions.\n\nThis is a distinction based on ???\n\n*** Putative distinctions\n\nThere are two more distinctions of which I am not sure I can genuinely draw them.\n\n**** Quantitative vs qualitative mismatch/contradiction.\n- Quantitative\n  Here I mean Norton's ellipsoid elongating to a cylinder: the mismatch comes from the ellipsoid having a certain volume/surface ratio in all finite stages, but a different one when infinitely long. No property is set to zero or infinity, unless you count \"cylinderness\".\n- Qualitative\n  Some property becomes true or false in the infinite limit which is not false or true in the finite case. Most of the actual examples are here: having or not having phase transitions, being 2D or 3D, exhibiting or not exhibiting an effect\n\n  The reason I doubt this distinction is because I feel like it's a question of framing. A very important question, which I should investigate, but not a distinction of kind per se.\n\n**** Logical/transcendental contradiction vs a physical/intuitive contradiction.\n\nThe former is exemplified by Streven's infinite population example: the main problem is that for an infinite population it is no longer possible to have countable additivity with a uniform distribution, and so you cannot use the Strong Law of Large Numbers and could not say anything about the probability of genetic drift (might be badly paraphrasing): the method itself is no longer useful, but it's not a direct self-contradiction as the infinite sphere, as an infinite population is a sensible concept. The latter is a bit more vague, but here I mean e.g. the thermodynamic limit: it does not work because it stipulates an inifite number of particles. However, this is in conflict with the whole idea that the world is made up of molecules. BUT not directly so, as cite:Shech2013 points out, it is only a real paradox if we stipulate that statistical mechanics in the thermodynamic limit is a true/accurate representaiton of the world, which we need to justify by e.g. (or i.e.? I don't know of any others) an indispensability argument.\n\nThis is a distinction based on????\n\nI doubt this because the former category might refer to the same as \"absent\" idealizations.\n\n** Order of the distinctions\n\nI think the order is best explained by this beautiful diagram, the whole box being \"idealization-space\". Not included is how this is linked to approximations, nor the distinctions I am unsure about, this is simply to show how the above distinctions work:\n\n[[../HPS/Thesis/Beautiful_Images/idealization_distinctions.png]]\n\n** Discussion\n\n\nWhile these distinctions might appear nitpicky, I think they are vital for making sure we are discussing the correct problem. Additionally, in making these distinctions it became clear that perhaps more distinctions need to be made, such as the specific nature of the contradiction induced, see Section \\ref{sec:orgff730de}.\n\nWhat is clear is how infinite idealizations (the interesting ones at least) differ from idealizations in general or simple ones. Infinite idealizations are a subcategory of idealizations, together with simple idealizations (whether they completely fill the category of idealization is left open). However, the distinction between infinite idealizations and simple idealizations does not prove particularly enlightening. Other distinctions will be more fruitful to investigate.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n"},{"count":2,"added":true,"value":"# "},{"count":61,"value":"This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** "},{"count":4,"removed":true,"value":"1.4 "},{"count":662,"value":"Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all!

This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far!

Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality \\eqref{eq:perturbation} to hold.\n\nIdeally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n** Writing down the LWF\n\nThis problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\nWhile this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small. Instead it is guessed and shown to be similar enough to the actual WF to be useful.\n$N=\\frac{AB}{\\phi_0}e^-$\n$\\hbar\\omega_B >> E_{cont}>>V_{disorder}$\nThe Laughlin WF only applies to the filling fractions of $\\nu=\\frac{1}{m}$\n\n*** Step one is admitting you have a problem\n\n How is it guessed?

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\nTo see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\n(note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\nThe handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n\\]\nIf we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n. However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\nNow, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\nTo get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n"},{"count":2,"added":true,"value":"\n\n"},{"count":2,"value":"* "},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"The"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"Geometric"},{"count":1,"value":" "},{"count":20,"added":true,"value":"Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ "},{"count":2,"value":"explanation "},{"count":32,"added":true,"value":"for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization "},{"count":2,"value":"of "},{"count":137,"added":true,"value":"2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n\n\n\n**** Dawdling\nNow that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nInteger is somewhat interesting but only insofar as it allows us to sort of get why the plateuax are there, although this explanation does not really work for the FQHE as it does not take electron interactions into account which are crucial\n#BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  IQHE\n\n\n***  Landaus\n\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223165225-landau_levels_in_an_electric_field.org][Landau levels in an electric field]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223160810-derivation_of_landau_levels_for_qhe.org][derivation of Landau levels for QHE]]\n\n\n***  Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\nImpurities\n\n\n\n\n However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample.

In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\nDo this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n\"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality \\eqref{eq:perturbation} to hold.\n\nIdeally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n** Writing down the LWF\n\nThis problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\nWhile this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small. Instead it is guessed and shown to be similar enough to the actual WF to be useful.\n$N=\\frac{AB}{\\phi_0}e^-$\n$\\hbar\\omega_B >> E_{cont}>>V_{disorder}$\nThe Laughlin WF only applies to the filling fractions of $\\nu=\\frac{1}{m}$\n\n*** Step one is admitting you have a problem\n\n How is it guessed?

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\nTo see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\n(note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\nThe handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n\\]\nIf we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n. However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\nNow, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\nTo get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [[file:phase_factor.org][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protogonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Footnotes\n[fn:4] Instead imagine taking this same journey in your backyard: walking 5 steps foward, then walking 5 steps with a ninety degree angle to your left, then walking 5 steps back.

This phase is obtained when a state is transported along parameter space from its starting position and back again, completing a loop.\n\n* The importance of the adiabatic theorem\n\n  The adiabatic theorem seems to be important for the computation of the Berry phase, serving a similar role as \"parallel\" in [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]: by keeping the system in the same phase, we can reasonably talk about its phase difference and discard the phase evolution. But, this only happens in the limit of the state being transformed infinitely slowly.\n\n  =Luckily, this limit is smoothly approached, just as it is for parallel transport: if we don't keep the vector /precisely/ parallel but only approximatley, we still get some angle difference despite us not being perfect.=\n\n\n* Berry phase calculation in 2D\n\n  Here we calculate the Berry phase over the Berry Connection\n\n  ...\n=ADD EXPLANATION THAT SHOWS THIS=\n\n\n  We see that we still get a discontinuous jump at $k=2\\pi$ when the loop comes back around, which does not seem like an improvement from our topological example, the only thing we have changed is instead of talking about topology we talk about geometry.\n\n  However, this is in fact quite the improvement, because geometry can be somewhat more easily be changed than topology (cutting a hole in a space is more difficult than making it a bit smoother). We will look at an example\n\n* The Cone Example and Holonomy\n\n  The initial way of calculating the Berry phase shows that we still get a discontinuous jump, which is bad. Here we will see that sometimes this can be removed, by looking at the parallel transport of a vector around a cone.\n\n  Parallel transport is a bit strange. On a flat Euclidean plane, nothing happens.\n  A cone is like a flat Euclidean plane glued together in a weird way, like this\n\n[[./media/conefold.png]]\n\nWhere side $s$ is glued to side $?$ in order to yield a smooth surface, with the exception of the problematic point $S$.\n\nWe can then calculate our parallel transport by simply \"doing\" the parallel transport on the surface of the \"flat\" cone.\n\nThe vector is transport from the one side to the other, eventually reaching the edge $s$, from where it is suddenly teleported to $s$, ending up with a much different angle.\n\n[[./media/transport.jpeg]]\nhttps://www.physicsforums.com/threads/parallel-transport-and-cone.1000209/\n\n\nThis angle difference is directly related to the angle of the cone. We see that the sharper the cone, the bigger the failure of parallel transport (holonomy) will be.\n\nThe strange thing is, of course, that this angle difference appears rather suddenly only after we completed >1 round. However, were we to move an 'actual' vector on a cone, we'd expect this to happen slowly, right? We want to get rid of the \"discontinuous jump\".\n\nThis question proves rather difficult to answer, for two reasons.\n1. The holonomic angle is only defined when the vector returns to its original position, we don't expect thing to be the same when we simply stop the transport somewhere in the middle.\n2. Actual cones are not this pointy.\n\nhttp://applet-magic.com/paralleltransport.htm\n\nIn actuality, when you deform the cone in the figure above, the angle /does/ change continuously along the path of the cone wrt beginning angle, but that's very often the case and does not count.\n\nInstead of having the continuous parameter be the angle of the cone, a better one would be the \"path\", since we are interested in paths after all. Here we see that if we take any path that does not cross the \"seam\", the angle remains 0. But the seam is kind of arbitrary, so that is not really fair.\nWe do know, however, that if the path encircles the tip of the cone it definitely passes the seam. So now we have our discontinuity: all paths that do not cross the tip do not gain a holomorphic angle (because those paths are the same as paths in Euclidean spacetime), while as soon as the path encompasses the origin it has to cross the seam and thus gains an angle $\\phi$.\n\nSince this failure of parallel transport is a geometric property, we say that all the geometric information of the cone is centered in one point, because inclusion of that point in the path makes or breaks the angle.\n\n** Less pointy cone\n\n\n   As we see, the thing we then need to change in order to get a more smooth cone holonomy is the tip. At the moment we have only one point which is problematic. This can be seen as our idealization: an infinitely sharp cone instead of a blunt one.\n\n   When we blunt the cone, we suddenly see that the path can be continuously deformed to include the \"seam\". However, what we have gained in smoothness we have lost in mathematical simplicity: we no longer can easily relate the cone to the Euclidean plane. In order to describe the blunt cone, we need to describe it's /connection/ and do some differential geometry.\n\n   ...\n\n   Now we see that the cone is good.\n\n* Relating this back to anyons\n\n  The case with anyons is similar: we calculate the geometric phase using the fact that the space has one anomolous point, namely the spot where the other particle is.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

We turn on a constant magx I H V B, B pointing in the z-direction. Meanwhile, the electrons are restricted to move only in the (x, y)plane. A constant current I is made to flow in the x-direction. The Hall effect is the statement that this induces a voltage VH (H is for “Hall”) in the y-direction. This is shown in the figure= ref:chetong.\n#+caption: Classical Hall effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:chetong\n[[./media/chetong.png]]\n\nSince the voltage $V_H$ linearly depends on the Lorentz force, which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field $B$, $V_H$ linearly depends on $B$ and thus, classically, we expect the graph to look like Figure ref:linresistance. Similarly, we don't expect the resistance along the strip $\\rho_{xx}$ to vary either. =Bit more explanation for why we do not expect this=\n#+caption: caption Linear Resistance\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:linresistance\n[[./media/linresistance.png]]\n\nNote that for computational ease we are measuring and calculating the /resistivity/ along a certain axis rather than the voltage.\n\nHowever, as is often the case in physics, systems can behave rather differently from our classical expectations when put in extreme circumstances. These circumstances, in this case, include extremely low temperatures ($<2K$), strong magnetic fields ($>>1T$) and rather pure samples (but, as we shall see, not too pure either.) When these conditions are met, the graph looks something more like Figure ref:ifqhe\n\n#+caption: Integer and fractional effects\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ifqhe\n[[./media/fqhe.png]]\n\nAfter a certain magnetic field strength has been reached, these plateaux start to show up. The question then of course is: why?\n\n\n*** Preliminaries\n\n To understand why the QHE arises, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, unsurprisingly first described by Landau, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task. =Badly written=\n\n\n# **** Quantization\n# Not necessary according to Guido, which I agree with\n#+begin_comment\n=I'm over explaining here=\nThe (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n#+end_comment\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nThere are not one but two quantum Hall effects: the integer and the fractional. Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[[file:20210219125647-quantum_of_resistance.org][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin. In fact, we take the material to be so thin that it becomes $2D$. This choice will come back to haunt us, but it is (for now) the only way of understanding the effect.=\n\n   Naturally, a physicist, after obtaining these results, would ask: why are these plateaux there? We can split this question into two subquestions:\n1. Why are there plateaux at all?\n2. Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct! While not trivial, it turns out that these plateaux correspond to the spectrum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, whose energy levels are called [[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]. Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection? Do the plateaux correspond to these energy levels?\n\n     Experimentally, we know that on one of these plateaux the transversal resistivity is\n     \\[\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2} \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\]\n     $\\nu$ being the /i/s in Figure ref:fig:iqhe.\n\n     From our =rough calculation=, we expect that this conductivity depends on the densitiy of electrons $n$\n     \\[\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{B}{ne} \\]\n\n     Equating the two, we get\n     \\begin{equation}\n    n=\\frac{Be}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\nu\n    \\label{eq:landaufilling}\n\\end{equation}\nas the number of electrons in unit area.\n\nIf we can show that the degeneracy of a Landau level is the same, we would be reasonably assured that the plateaus $\\nu$ occur when a $\\nu$ Landau levels are exactly filled.\n=I HAVE NOT SHOWN ANYTHING=\n\n\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*Edge modes are very important, but sound rather mysterious. However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161230-iqhe_has_no_electron_interactions_fqhe_does.org][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161322-reasoning_of_fqhe_is_less_rigorous_than_iqhe.org][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\n It would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n\n*** TODO Finding the wavefunction\n\n [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n\n While you might think that quantum mechanics is easy[fn:2], it is actually rather difficult to solve the equations of systems barely larger than a Helium atom. In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\n Do this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n \"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality ref:eq:perturbation to hold.\n\n Ideally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n*** TODO Writing down the LWF\n\n This problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\n While this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n  Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\n To see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n where, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n (note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\n The handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [[file:phase_factor.org][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere).

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

Similarly, we don't expect the resistance along the strip $\\rho_{xx}$ to vary either. =Bit more explanation for why we do not expect this=\n#+caption: caption Linear Resistance\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:linresistance\n[[./media/linresistance.png]]\n\nNote that for computational ease we are measuring and calculating the /resistivity/ along a certain axis rather than the voltage.\n\nHowever, as is often the case in physics, systems can behave rather differently from our classical expectations when put in extreme circumstances. These circumstances, in this case, include extremely low temperatures ($<2K$), strong magnetic fields ($>>1T$) and rather pure samples (but, as we shall see, not too pure either.) When these conditions are met, the graph looks something more like Figure ref:ifqhe\n\n#+caption: Integer and fractional effects\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ifqhe\n[[./media/fqhe.png]]\n\nAfter a certain magnetic field strength has been reached, these plateaux start to show up. The question then of course is: why?\n\n\n*** Preliminaries\n\n To understand why the QHE arises, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, unsurprisingly first described by Landau, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task. =Badly written=\n\n\n# **** Quantization\n# Not necessary according to Guido, which I agree with\n#+begin_comment\n=I'm over explaining here=\nThe (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n#+end_comment\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nThere are not one but two quantum Hall effects: the integer and the fractional. Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[[file:20210219125647-quantum_of_resistance.org][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin. In fact, we take the material to be so thin that it becomes $2D$. This choice will come back to haunt us, but it is (for now) the only way of understanding the effect.=\n\n   Naturally, a physicist, after obtaining these results, would ask: why are these plateaux there? We can split this question into two subquestions:\n1. Why are there plateaux at all?\n2. Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct! While not trivial, it turns out that these plateaux correspond to the spectrum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, whose energy levels are called [[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]. Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection? Do the plateaux correspond to these energy levels?\n\n     Experimentally, we know that on one of these plateaux the transversal resistivity is\n     \\[\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2} \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\]\n     $\\nu$ being the /i/s in Figure ref:fig:iqhe.\n\n     From our =rough calculation=, we expect that this conductivity depends on the densitiy of electrons $n$\n     \\[\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{B}{ne} \\]\n\n     Equating the two, we get\n     \\begin{equation}\n    n=\\frac{Be}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\nu\n    \\label{eq:landaufilling}\n\\end{equation}\nas the number of electrons in unit area.\n\nIf we can show that the degeneracy of a Landau level is the same, we would be reasonably assured that the plateaus $\\nu$ occur when a $\\nu$ Landau levels are exactly filled.\n=I HAVE NOT SHOWN ANYTHING=\n\n\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*Edge modes are very important, but sound rather mysterious. However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161230-iqhe_has_no_electron_interactions_fqhe_does.org][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161322-reasoning_of_fqhe_is_less_rigorous_than_iqhe.org][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former.

In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\n Do this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n \"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality ref:eq:perturbation to hold.\n\n Ideally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n*** TODO Writing down the LWF\n\n This problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\n To see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n where, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n (note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\n The handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [[file:phase_factor.org][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protagonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n** Geometry?

It is argued that if this explanation would succeed in the way described above, we would have a reasonable case for an actual sectioning off of reality?

The groundwork needed for the explanation to get things of the ground is laid: the CHE is explained in more detail, Landau levels are introduced and the distinction between the Integer and Fractional QHE is clarified, and the former is (for now) made clear to be less important to explain\n\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n*****  To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n*****  Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting a vibe of the thing\n\n***** Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n...\n\n**** Quantization\n\n***** The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n***** First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n*****  From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n***** Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n*****  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\nOperators are functions which spit out other functions, rather than a scalar or vector.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTada\n\n**** Important details and idealizations\n\n***** Astute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\n***** An additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n[[file:20210223162026-the_dimensions_of_the_hall_system_is_set_to_2_from_the_start.org][The dimensions of the Hall system is set to 2 from the start]]\n\n\n*** e. The FQHE is set up in more detail, with the goal of making clear which idealizing assumptions are made, such as the LWF, the plasma analogy and why the toy model is needed.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

We turn on a constant magx I H V B, B pointing in the z-direction. Meanwhile, the electrons are restricted to move only in the (x, y)plane. A constant current I is made to flow in the x-direction. The Hall effect is the statement that this induces a voltage VH (H is for “Hall”) in the y-direction. This is shown in the figure= ref:chetong.\n#+caption: Classical Hall effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:chetong\n[[./media/chetong.png]]\n\nSince the voltage $V_H$ linearly depends on the Lorentz force, which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field $B$, $V_H$ linearly depends on $B$ and thus, classically, we expect the graph to look like Figure ref:linresistance. Similarly, we don't expect the resistance along the strip $\\rho_{xx}$ to vary either. =Bit more explanation for why we do not expect this=\n#+caption: caption Linear Resistance\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:linresistance\n[[./media/linresistance.png]]\n\nNote that for computational ease we are measuring and calculating the /resistivity/ along a certain axis rather than the voltage.\n\nHowever, as is often the case in physics, systems can behave rather differently from our classical expectations when put in extreme circumstances. These circumstances, in this case, include extremely low temperatures ($<2K$), strong magnetic fields ($>>1T$) and rather pure samples (but, as we shall see, not too pure either.) When these conditions are met, the graph looks something more like Figure ref:ifqhe\n\n#+caption: Integer and fractional effects\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ifqhe\n[[./media/fqhe.png]]\n\nAfter a certain magnetic field strength has been reached, these plateaux start to show up.

These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, unsurprisingly first described by Landau, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task. =Badly written=\n\n\n# **** Quantization\n# Not necessary according to Guido, which I agree with\n#+begin_comment\n=I'm over explaining here=\nThe (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels.

This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n#+end_comment\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nThere are not one but two quantum Hall effects: the integer and the fractional. Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[[file:20210219125647-quantum_of_resistance.org][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin. In fact, we take the material to be so thin that it becomes $2D$. This choice will come back to haunt us, but it is (for now) the only way of understanding the effect.=\n\n   Naturally, a physicist, after obtaining these results, would ask: why are these plateaux there? We can split this question into two subquestions:\n1. Why are there plateaux at all?\n2. Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct! While not trivial, it turns out that these plateaux correspond to the spectrum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, whose energy levels are called [[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]. Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection? Do the plateaux correspond to these energy levels?\n\n     Experimentally, we know that on one of these plateaux the transversal resistivity is\n     \\[\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2} \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\]\n     $\\nu$ being the /i/s in Figure ref:fig:iqhe.\n\n     From our =rough calculation=, we expect that this conductivity depends on the densitiy of electrons $n$\n     \\[\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{B}{ne} \\]\n\n     Equating the two, we get\n     \\begin{equation}\n    n=\\frac{Be}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\nu\n    \\label{eq:landaufilling}\n\\end{equation}\nas the number of electrons in unit area.\n\nIf we can show that the degeneracy of a Landau level is the same, we would be reasonably assured that the plateaus $\\nu$ occur when a $\\nu$ Landau levels are exactly filled.\n=I HAVE NOT SHOWN ANYTHING=\n\n\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*Edge modes are very important, but sound rather mysterious. However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161230-iqhe_has_no_electron_interactions_fqhe_does.org][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161322-reasoning_of_fqhe_is_less_rigorous_than_iqhe.org][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former.

In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\n Do this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n \"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality ref:eq:perturbation to hold.\n\n Ideally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n*** TODO Writing down the LWF\n\n This problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\n While this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n  Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\n To see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n where, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n (note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\n The handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [[file:phase_factor.org][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protagonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n** Geometry?

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\nThis might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n** 1.4 Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons. If we were to examine the anyons first .....\n\n* The quantum hall effect\n** Once again, what is it\n*** Classical Hall effect\n\n[[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\n*** Preliminaries\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n\n To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n**** Dawdling\n\nNow that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n*** Integer vs Fractional\n\nInteger is somewhat interesting but only insofar as it allows us to sort of get why the plateuax are there, although this explanation does not really work for the FQHE as it does not take electron interactions into account which are crucial\n#BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n\n** IQHE\n*** Landaus\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223165225-landau_levels_in_an_electric_field.org][Landau levels in an electric field]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223160810-derivation_of_landau_levels_for_qhe.org][derivation of Landau levels for QHE]]\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*** Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\nImpurities\n\n\n\n\n However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample.

In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\nDo this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n\"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality \\eqref{eq:perturbation} to hold.\n\nIdeally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n** Writing down the LWF\n\nThis problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\nWhile this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small. Instead it is guessed and shown to be similar enough to the actual WF to be useful.\n$N=\\frac{AB}{\\phi_0}e^-$\n$\\hbar\\omega_B >> E_{cont}>>V_{disorder}$\nThe Laughlin WF only applies to the filling fractions of $\\nu=\\frac{1}{m}$\n\n*** Step one is admitting you have a problem\n\n How is it guessed?

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\nTo see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\n(note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\nThe handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n\\]\nIf we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n. However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\nNow, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\nTo get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n* The explanation of anyons\n\n  #+include: \"./20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org\" :minlevel 4\n\n[[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]]\n\n#+include: \"./20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org\" :minlevel 4\n[[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n** TODO \n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210414155705-proof_ballspace_is_not_simply_connected.org][Proof ballspace is not simply connected]]\n\n#+transclude: t :level 2\n[[file:20210414155524-how_does_qm_work_in_non_simply_connected_space.org][How does QM work in non-simply connected space?]]\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210414155618-how_to_justify_particles_not_being_able_to_escape.org][How to justify particles not being able to escape]]\n\n* Footnotes\n\n[fn:3] The spin-statistics theorem is only provable in relativistic quantum mechanics.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"or"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"lor"},{"count":18752,"value":" \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all!

This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

We turn on a constant magx I H V B, B pointing in the z-direction. Meanwhile, the electrons are restricted to move only in the (x, y)plane. A constant current I is made to flow in the x-direction. The Hall effect is the statement that this induces a voltage VH (H is for “Hall”) in the y-direction. This is shown in the figure= ref:chetong.\n#+caption: Classical Hall effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:chetong\n[[./media/chetong.png]]\n\nSince the voltage $V_H$ linearly depends on the Lorentz force, which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field $B$, $V_H$ linearly depends on $B$ and thus, classically, we expect the graph to look like Figure ref:linresistance. Similarly, we don't expect the resistance along the strip $\\rho_{xx}$ to vary either. =Bit more explanation for why we do not expect this=\n#+caption: caption Linear Resistance\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:linresistance\n[[./media/linresistance.png]]\n\nNote that for computational ease we are measuring and calculating the /resistivity/ along a certain axis rather than the voltage.\n\nHowever, as is often the case in physics, systems can behave rather differently from our classical expectations when put in extreme circumstances. These circumstances, in this case, include extremely low temperatures ($<2K$), strong magnetic fields ($>>1T$) and rather pure samples (but, as we shall see, not too pure either.) When these conditions are met, the graph looks something more like Figure ref:ifqhe\n\n#+caption: Integer and fractional effects\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ifqhe\n[[./media/fqhe.png]]\n\nAfter a certain magnetic field strength has been reached, these plateaux start to show up. The question then of course is: why?\n\n\n*** Preliminaries\n\n To understand why the QHE arises, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, unsurprisingly first described by Landau, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task. =Badly written=\n\n\n# **** Quantization\n# Not necessary according to Guido, which I agree with\n#+begin_comment\n=I'm over explaining here=\nThe (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n#+end_comment\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nThere are not one but two quantum Hall effects: the integer and the fractional. Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[[file:20210219125647-quantum_of_resistance.org][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin. In fact, we take the material to be so thin that it becomes $2D$. This choice will come back to haunt us, but it is (for now) the only way of understanding the effect.=\n\n   Naturally, a physicist, after obtaining these results, would ask: why are these plateaux there? We can split this question into two subquestions:\n1. Why are there plateaux at all?\n2. Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct! While not trivial, it turns out that these plateaux correspond to the spectrum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, whose energy levels are called [[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]. Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection? Do the plateaux correspond to these energy levels?\n\n     Experimentally, we know that on one of these plateaux the transversal resistivity is\n     \\[\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2} \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\]\n     $\\nu$ being the /i/s in Figure ref:fig:iqhe.\n\n     From our =rough calculation=, we expect that this conductivity depends on the densitiy of electrons $n$\n     \\[\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{B}{ne} \\]\n\n     Equating the two, we get\n     \\begin{equation}\n    n=\\frac{Be}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\nu\n    \\label{eq:landaufilling}\n\\end{equation}\nas the number of electrons in unit area.\n\nIf we can show that the degeneracy of a Landau level is the same, we would be reasonably assured that the plateaus $\\nu$ occur when a $\\nu$ Landau levels are exactly filled.\n=I HAVE NOT SHOWN ANYTHING=\n\n\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*Edge modes are very important, but sound rather mysterious. However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161230-iqhe_has_no_electron_interactions_fqhe_does.org][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161322-reasoning_of_fqhe_is_less_rigorous_than_iqhe.org][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\n It would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n\n*** TODO Finding the wavefunction\n\n [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n\n While you might think that quantum mechanics is easy[fn:2], it is actually rather difficult to solve the equations of systems barely larger than a Helium atom. In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\n Do this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n \"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality ref:eq:perturbation to hold.\n\n Ideally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n*** TODO Writing down the LWF\n\n This problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\n While this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n  Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\n To see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n where, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n (note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\n The handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [[file:phase_factor.org][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protagonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n** Geometry?

In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named \"anyons\".\n\nA particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.\n\n** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space\n\nHow do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?\nWe have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.\n\nAs mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.\n\nUsing the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.\n\n** Naive exchange\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):\n\nWe start out with a wavefunction $\\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_1\\psi_2\\]\n\nIf we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [[file:20210210115635-phase_transitions.org][phase transitions]]\n\n\\[\\Psi_\\pi=e^{i\\theta\\pi}\\psi_2\\psi_1\\]\n\nExchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with\n\n\\[\\Psi_{2\\pi}=e^{i2\\pi\\theta}\\Psi_0\\]\n\nTherefore, $e^{i2\\pi\\theta}=1 \\rightarrow e^{i\\pi\\theta}=\\pm 1$, which leads to $\\theta=0 \\lor \\theta=1$.\n\nWe have therefore \"shown\" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\\theta=0$) and fermions ($\\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.\n\n** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not \"the operator framework\" )\n\nWhat we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.\n\n(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)\n\nThe three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation\n\n\\begin{equation}\n[S_i,S_j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K\n    \\label{eq:spincomm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nIf we take the state $\\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^2\\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:spinsquared}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\nS_3\\ket{s,m}=m\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:s3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nthen we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^+\\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\\ket{s,m+1}=\\ket{s,m'}\n    \\label{eq:splus}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf we require $\\sqrt{|\\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\ns(s+1)-m(m+1)\\geq0 \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:posnorm}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq s \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:ms}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIt is clear then, that for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so\n\\begin{equation}\ns-m= n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:int}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimilarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s=n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:mpluss}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining \\eqref{eq:int} and \\eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s+s-m=2s=n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow s=\\frac{n}{2}\n    \\label{eq:proofofinteger}\n\\end{equation}\nSince $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.\n\nSo, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.\n\n*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng\n\n*** TODO Spin statistics relation\n\n\n** Configuration space framework\n\nThe above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.\n\nLuckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows\n\n1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles\n2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space\n3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange\n\nIt almost seems too easy.\n\nLet's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).\n\nWithout any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d\\]\n\nHowever, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.\n\n\n\nWe need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )\n\nLet us call the set of diagonal points $\\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\\mathbf{r}=(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})$.\n\n\nThen, for our configuration space looks like\n\\begin{equation}\nQ= \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d  - \\Delta }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:confspaceddim}\n\\end{equation}\n\n# =just blantantly copied=\nIn order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can \"discard\" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in\n\\begin{equation}\nS=\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d -\\Delta}{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:S}\n\\end{equation}\n\nBefore showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....\n\n*** 3D\nLet's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\\Delta$, which for $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1 -\\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).\n\n[[./media/3dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\n\n=Copying again=\n\nAn exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be \"looping it around\" the sphere (path C).\n\nWhat is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.\n\nNow we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha^2=+1 \\rightarrow \\alpha = \\pm 1\n    \\label{eq:doubleexchange}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.\n\n\n*** 2D\n\nLet us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.\n\n[[./media/2dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 2D exchange\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\nWe make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.\n\nHowever, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the \"string\" cannot collapse to single point in principle.\n\nTherefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\\alpha$ has no effect on $|\\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}\n    \\label{eq:phasephase}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n*** Connection to the Braid group\n\nThe above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way?

The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.\n\nInstead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.\n\nWith \"finding an alternative route\", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.\n1. Bob takes anti-conception pills\n2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant\nC. Bob does not become pregnant.\n\nWhile we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with. This idealization might not be as problematic however. (this is later or earlier, haven't figured out where to put it)\n\n=garbo=\nNext, we have an equally unpromising candidate, which is the \"mini-explanation\". The fundamental group of 2D exchange under two particles is the Braid group\nE. The fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of $N$ identical particles in 2D is $B_N$\nL.

(secretly I don't really know how to write this out DN style as the example laws are always extremely simple conditionals, nor do I really know how to transfer this to theorems rather than laws.

Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with.

In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*\n\n** Options\n\n*** Particles have nonzero size\n\nIn these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.\n\n*** Not ALL paths\n\nWhile the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.\n\n\n*** Winding can be something different?\nThe main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210403175539-group.org][Group]]\n\n\n\n\n** COMMENT Junk\n\n Startingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.\n\n However, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one. While I agree the 3D space cannot approximate 2D space if the property under consideration is connectedness as presented, I do think it is possible for some other factor down the argumentative line to be considered \"approximately instantiated\" in the Nortonian sense.\n\n We just need to find a different path to \"fit in\" to the explanation of the possibility of anyons, i.e. either\n 1. 2D space is approximately instatiated in the experiment due to thinness and strong fields, giving rise to something with the same properties as 2D space\n 2.

In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named \"anyons\".\n\nA particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.\n\n** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space\n\nHow do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?\nWe have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.\n\nAs mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.\n\nUsing the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.\n\n** Naive exchange\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):\n\nWe start out with a wavefunction $\\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_1\\psi_2\\]\n\nIf we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [[file:20210210115635-phase_transitions.org][phase transitions]]\n\n\\[\\Psi_\\pi=e^{i\\theta\\pi}\\psi_2\\psi_1\\]\n\nExchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with\n\n\\[\\Psi_{2\\pi}=e^{i2\\pi\\theta}\\Psi_0\\]\n\nTherefore, $e^{i2\\pi\\theta}=1 \\rightarrow e^{i\\pi\\theta}=\\pm 1$, which leads to $\\theta=0 \\lor \\theta=1$.\n\nWe have therefore \"shown\" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\\theta=0$) and fermions ($\\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.\n\n** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not \"the operator framework\" )\n\nWhat we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.\n\n(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)\n\nThe three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation\n\n\\begin{equation}\n[S_i,S_j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K\n    \\label{eq:spincomm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nIf we take the state $\\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^2\\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:spinsquared}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\nS_3\\ket{s,m}=m\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:s3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nthen we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^+\\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\\ket{s,m+1}=\\ket{s,m'}\n    \\label{eq:splus}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf we require $\\sqrt{|\\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\ns(s+1)-m(m+1)\\geq0 \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:posnorm}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq s \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:ms}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIt is clear then, that for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so\n\\begin{equation}\ns-m= n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:int}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimilarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s=n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:mpluss}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining \\eqref{eq:int} and \\eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s+s-m=2s=n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow s=\\frac{n}{2}\n    \\label{eq:proofofinteger}\n\\end{equation}\nSince $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.\n\nSo, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.\n\n*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng\n\n*** TODO Spin statistics relation\n\n\n** Configuration space framework\n\nThe above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.\n\nLuckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows\n\n1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles\n2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space\n3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange\n\nIt almost seems too easy.\n\nLet's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).\n\nWithout any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d\\]\n\nHowever, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.\n\n\n\nWe need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )\n\nLet us call the set of diagonal points $\\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\\mathbf{r}=(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})$.\n\n\nThen, for our configuration space looks like\n\\begin{equation}\nQ= \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d  - \\Delta }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:confspaceddim}\n\\end{equation}\n\n# =just blantantly copied=\nIn order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can \"discard\" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in\n\\begin{equation}\nS=\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d -\\Delta}{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:S}\n\\end{equation}\n\nBefore showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....\n\n*** 3D\nLet's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\\Delta$, which for $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1 -\\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).\n\n[[./media/3dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\n\n=Copying again=\n\nAn exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be \"looping it around\" the sphere (path C).\n\nWhat is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.\n\nNow we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha^2=+1 \\rightarrow \\alpha = \\pm 1\n    \\label{eq:doubleexchange}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.\n\n\n*** 2D\n\nLet us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.\n\n[[./media/2dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 2D exchange\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\nWe make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.\n\nHowever, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the \"string\" cannot collapse to single point in principle.\n\nTherefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\\alpha$ has no effect on $|\\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}\n    \\label{eq:phasephase}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n*** Connection to the Braid group\n\nThe above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way?

However, I would dispute that this is the case here, first and foremost on the grounds that this conclusion is /primae facie/ unacceptable and a paradox, so something seems to go wrong here.

The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.\n\nInstead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.\n\nWith \"finding an alternative route\", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.\n1. Bob takes anti-conception pills\n2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant\nC. Bob does not become pregnant.\n\nWhile we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other.

In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*\n\n** Options\n\n*** Particles have nonzero size\n\nIn these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.\n\n*** Not ALL paths\n\nWhile the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.\n\n\n*** Winding can be something different?\nThe main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.\n\n"},{"count":1,"value":"#+"},{"count":4,"removed":true,"value":"transclude: t"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"end_comment"},{"count":1,"value":"\n"},{"count":760,"removed":true,"value":"[[file:20210403175539-group.org][Group]]\n\n\n\n\n* COMMENT Junk\n\nStartingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.\n\nHowever, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one. While I agree the 3D space cannot approximate 2D space if the property under consideration is connectedness as presented, I do think it is possible for some other factor down the argumentative line to be considered \"approximately instantiated\" in the Nortonian sense.\n\nWe just need to find a different path to \"fit in\" to the explanation of the possibility of anyons, i.e. either\n1. 2D space is approximately instatiated in the experiment due to thinness and strong fields, giving rise to something with the same properties as 2D space\n2. Holes are approximately instantiated, for instance ??\n3. Connectedness is approximate, in the sense that we don't care about /all/ paths but just most paths, and we can create a lot of paths which don't work well\n4. Homotopy classes are approximate, in the sense that we don't derive the homotopy classes from the connectedness of the space but from looking at different paths and seeing that they /don't/ act the same way. rather than that they /can't/ act the same way\n5. Fundamental group is approximate, in the sense that we don't look at all the homotopy classes but look at what kind of behavior the elements of the group have\n6. 1D rep is approximate. I don't see how this would work.\n7. Equivalence between spin is approximate, in the sense that there is some other physical mechanism which causes the phase to be such which does not rely on the above, such as the Berry phase calculation.\n\n\nSo, which of these is the most likely canditate for approximate instantiation?\n"}],"additions":5,"deletions":2243}],"additions":5,"deletions":2243},{"oid":"61bb724b16cbe63e5aabcefff1e27c795f9a903d","message":"Scripted auto-commit on change (2021-06-06 15:09:43) by gitwatch.sh\n","date":1622984983,"files":[{"filepath":"chapter-anyons.org","oid":"36130281291264732d647317df9f387d5932bcdd","diff":[{"count":85,"value":"#+title: FQHE/anyon chapter\n#+roam_tags: chapter anyons FQHE\n#+OPTIONS: H:6 title:nil\n#+latex_header: \\usepackage{braket}\n\n* The Fractional quantum hall effect and its discontents\n\n# convince the reader that what you're saying is worthwhile\n\n"},{"count":50,"added":true,"value":"=The discussion of a system being a problematic idealization depending on which property we look at will probably be discussed in the previous chapter=\n"},{"count":21134,"value":"So, now that we have gained a high-level idea of idealizations, the question is: which idealizations are worth looking at? We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\lor \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

We turn on a constant magx I H V B, B pointing in the z-direction. Meanwhile, the electrons are restricted to move only in the (x, y)plane. A constant current I is made to flow in the x-direction. The Hall effect is the statement that this induces a voltage VH (H is for “Hall”) in the y-direction. This is shown in the figure= ref:chetong.\n#+caption: Classical Hall effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:chetong\n[[./media/chetong.png]]\n\nSince the voltage $V_H$ linearly depends on the Lorentz force, which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field $B$, $V_H$ linearly depends on $B$ and thus, classically, we expect the graph to look like Figure ref:linresistance. Similarly, we don't expect the resistance along the strip $\\rho_{xx}$ to vary either. =Bit more explanation for why we do not expect this=\n#+caption: caption Linear Resistance\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:linresistance\n[[./media/linresistance.png]]\n\nNote that for computational ease we are measuring and calculating the /resistivity/ along a certain axis rather than the voltage.\n\nHowever, as is often the case in physics, systems can behave rather differently from our classical expectations when put in extreme circumstances. These circumstances, in this case, include extremely low temperatures ($<2K$), strong magnetic fields ($>>1T$) and rather pure samples (but, as we shall see, not too pure either.) When these conditions are met, the graph looks something more like Figure ref:ifqhe\n\n#+caption: Integer and fractional effects\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ifqhe\n[[./media/fqhe.png]]\n\nAfter a certain magnetic field strength has been reached, these plateaux start to show up. The question then of course is: why?\n\n\n*** Preliminaries\n\n To understand why the QHE arises, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, unsurprisingly first described by Landau, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task. =Badly written=\n\n\n# **** Quantization\n# Not necessary according to Guido, which I agree with\n#+begin_comment\n=I'm over explaining here=\nThe (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n#+end_comment\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nThere are not one but two quantum Hall effects: the integer and the fractional. Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[[file:20210219125647-quantum_of_resistance.org][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin. In fact, we take the material to be so thin that it becomes $2D$. This choice will come back to haunt us, but it is (for now) the only way of understanding the effect.=\n\n   Naturally, a physicist, after obtaining these results, would ask: why are these plateaux there? We can split this question into two subquestions:\n1. Why are there plateaux at all?\n2. Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct! While not trivial, it turns out that these plateaux correspond to the spectrum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, whose energy levels are called [[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]. Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection? Do the plateaux correspond to these energy levels?\n\n     Experimentally, we know that on one of these plateaux the transversal resistivity is\n     \\[\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2} \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\]\n     $\\nu$ being the /i/s in Figure ref:fig:iqhe.\n\n     From our =rough calculation=, we expect that this conductivity depends on the densitiy of electrons $n$\n     \\[\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{B}{ne} \\]\n\n     Equating the two, we get\n     \\begin{equation}\n    n=\\frac{Be}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\nu\n    \\label{eq:landaufilling}\n\\end{equation}\nas the number of electrons in unit area.\n\nIf we can show that the degeneracy of a Landau level is the same, we would be reasonably assured that the plateaus $\\nu$ occur when a $\\nu$ Landau levels are exactly filled.\n=I HAVE NOT SHOWN ANYTHING=\n\n\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*Edge modes are very important, but sound rather mysterious. However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161230-iqhe_has_no_electron_interactions_fqhe_does.org][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161322-reasoning_of_fqhe_is_less_rigorous_than_iqhe.org][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\n It would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n\n*** TODO Finding the wavefunction\n\n [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n\n While you might think that quantum mechanics is easy[fn:2], it is actually rather difficult to solve the equations of systems barely larger than a Helium atom. In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\n Do this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n \"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality ref:eq:perturbation to hold.\n\n Ideally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n*** TODO Writing down the LWF\n\n This problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\n While this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n  Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\n To see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n where, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n (note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\n The handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [[file:phase_factor.org][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protagonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n** Geometry?

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\n"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"\n"},{"count":549,"value":"What makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"not"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"neg"},{"count":18808,"value":" P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3.

We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all!

This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

We turn on a constant magx I H V B, B pointing in the z-direction. Meanwhile, the electrons are restricted to move only in the (x, y)plane. A constant current I is made to flow in the x-direction. The Hall effect is the statement that this induces a voltage VH (H is for “Hall”) in the y-direction. This is shown in the figure= ref:chetong.\n#+caption: Classical Hall effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:chetong\n[[./media/chetong.png]]\n\nSince the voltage $V_H$ linearly depends on the Lorentz force, which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field $B$, $V_H$ linearly depends on $B$ and thus, classically, we expect the graph to look like Figure ref:linresistance. Similarly, we don't expect the resistance along the strip $\\rho_{xx}$ to vary either. =Bit more explanation for why we do not expect this=\n#+caption: caption Linear Resistance\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:linresistance\n[[./media/linresistance.png]]\n\nNote that for computational ease we are measuring and calculating the /resistivity/ along a certain axis rather than the voltage.\n\nHowever, as is often the case in physics, systems can behave rather differently from our classical expectations when put in extreme circumstances. These circumstances, in this case, include extremely low temperatures ($<2K$), strong magnetic fields ($>>1T$) and rather pure samples (but, as we shall see, not too pure either.) When these conditions are met, the graph looks something more like Figure ref:ifqhe\n\n#+caption: Integer and fractional effects\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ifqhe\n[[./media/fqhe.png]]\n\nAfter a certain magnetic field strength has been reached, these plateaux start to show up. The question then of course is: why?\n\n\n*** Preliminaries\n\n To understand why the QHE arises, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, unsurprisingly first described by Landau, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task. =Badly written=\n\n\n# **** Quantization\n# Not necessary according to Guido, which I agree with\n#+begin_comment\n=I'm over explaining here=\nThe (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n#+end_comment\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nThere are not one but two quantum Hall effects: the integer and the fractional. Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[[file:20210219125647-quantum_of_resistance.org][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin. In fact, we take the material to be so thin that it becomes $2D$. This choice will come back to haunt us, but it is (for now) the only way of understanding the effect.=\n\n   Naturally, a physicist, after obtaining these results, would ask: why are these plateaux there? We can split this question into two subquestions:\n1. Why are there plateaux at all?\n2. Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct! While not trivial, it turns out that these plateaux correspond to the spectrum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, whose energy levels are called [[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]. Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection? Do the plateaux correspond to these energy levels?\n\n     Experimentally, we know that on one of these plateaux the transversal resistivity is\n     \\[\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2} \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\]\n     $\\nu$ being the /i/s in Figure ref:fig:iqhe.\n\n     From our =rough calculation=, we expect that this conductivity depends on the densitiy of electrons $n$\n     \\[\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{B}{ne} \\]\n\n     Equating the two, we get\n     \\begin{equation}\n    n=\\frac{Be}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\nu\n    \\label{eq:landaufilling}\n\\end{equation}\nas the number of electrons in unit area.\n\nIf we can show that the degeneracy of a Landau level is the same, we would be reasonably assured that the plateaus $\\nu$ occur when a $\\nu$ Landau levels are exactly filled.\n=I HAVE NOT SHOWN ANYTHING=\n\n\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*Edge modes are very important, but sound rather mysterious. However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161230-iqhe_has_no_electron_interactions_fqhe_does.org][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161322-reasoning_of_fqhe_is_less_rigorous_than_iqhe.org][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\n It would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n\n*** TODO Finding the wavefunction\n\n [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n\n While you might think that quantum mechanics is easy[fn:2], it is actually rather difficult to solve the equations of systems barely larger than a Helium atom. In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\n Do this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n \"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality ref:eq:perturbation to hold.\n\n Ideally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n*** TODO Writing down the LWF\n\n This problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\n While this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n  Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\n To see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n where, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n (note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\n The handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin.

We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protagonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n** Geometry?

Therefore, since small 3D is not approximately 2D, the 2D idealization is truly indispensible to our explanation of the emergence of anyons and we therefore ought to take it ontologically seriously.\n\nNow that we have finally grasped the core of Shech's argument, we are at last able to push back a little. At the end of this chapter, I will have shown how to fully make sense of the emergence of anyons in the quantum Hall system without relying on the 2D idealization. Before that however, I want to make it at least somewhat plausible that this /can/ be done.\n\nTo start, as we have seen above, to derive the existence of anyons, i.e. particles whose phase under exchange $\\neq 0,1$ , we do not necessarily require the configuration space to be $2D$, but merely for said configuration space to be non-[[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]]. Therefore, it seems plausible that an approximate 3D explanation could get off the ground, if only we can show that it is non-simply connected. The rest of the chapter serves as that argument.\n\n** First steps\n\nTo gain some confidence in the idea, let us  prove that an idealized /3D/  configuration space can also be non-simply connected. The key reason why the 3D configuration space constructed previously is necessarily simply connected is due to the fact that we 'merely' have a zero-dimensional hole at the origin where the two particles would intersect, which, since we also want to describe fermions, is forbidden by the Pauli-exclusion principle.[fn:1]  According to our current best scientific theories, fermions (and presumably the anyons under question as well) are understood best as point-particles, and thus the intersection being a single point in configuration space seems to be justified. I claim, however, that if this condition would be relaxed, allowing for a larger \"forbidden\" space, then,  in conjunction with two other plausible premises, we arrive at a multiply connected 3D configuration space. If this sounds rather ad-hoc, that is because it is. The final argument will not rely on these assumptions, so for now I believe they cause little harm. although I will attempt some minor justification at the end of this section.\n\nThe main idea is the following: if the minimum distance between the particles is greater then the \"height\" of the configuration space (here the size of the QH system), the 3d configuration space becomes multiply connected as well, as there are no paths which will \"loop over\" the singularity points. Imagine a box with a billiard ball in the middle which pokes out of the top and bottom, this is a reasonable model for now for the possible configurations of the particles.\n\nTo construct this configuration space we require three conditions on top of the ones already mentioned before ($(\\mathbf{r_1}, \\mathbf{r_2})=(\\mathbf{r_2, r_1})$ and $|r|\\neq 0$)\n1. $\\Psi(r_i\\geq b_i)=0$ where $b_i \\quad i=x,y,z$ are the dimensions of the quantum Hall system. This says: the probability of finding the particle outside the quantum Hall system is $0$, which is not exactly true but for now works as a useful assumption, modeling the boundaries of the system as an infinite potential well\n2. $\\Psi(|r|\\leq a)=0$, where $a$ is some real number representing the minimum allowed distance between the two particles\n3. $b_x, b_y\\geq a \\geq b_z$ (or really any of the dimensions, it just needs to be )\n\nBoth of these will be argued for in more detail below, but for now I claim that /if/ $\\exists a\\geq \\beta\\in \\mathbb{R} \\quad \\Psi(r\\leq a)=0$, where \\beta is the height of the fractional quantum Hall system and \\alpha the minimum distance allowed between the two particles, then the resulting configuration space will be non-simply connected.\n\nTo briefly sketch an intuitive picture, let us recall our $d$-dimensional configuration space @@latex: \\eqref{confspaceddim} @@ and the fact that we are only really interested in the latter half of that configuration space, as the absolute position of the particles (e.g. the location of the quantum Hall system) should not really matter. So we are just looking at the paths in\n\\[S=\\frac{\\mathbb{R} ^3-\\Delta }{Z_2} \\]\n\nNow we add our conditions above. 2) creates a sphere of forbidden particle positions around the origin (where the particles are near one another), which we can model as subtracting those a sphere of radius $\\alpha$, called  $\\sigma$, from the configuration space. Since \\sigma encompasses the points \\Delta, we can leave out \\Delta. Additionally,  1) means we are excising the points outside of the QH system, which I will represent with $\\beta$ , which are the points ranging from $[-\\frac{b_i}{2},+\\frac{b_i}{2}] \\quad i=x,y,z$ .[fn:2] Thus creating our new configuration space for $2$ particles\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tilde{Q}'= \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^{3} -\\sigma -\\beta  }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:goodconf}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhich can be crudely represented as\n[[./media/ballspace.png]]\n#+caption: Exaggerated representation of $\\tilde{Q}'$\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ballspace\n\n*** \"Proof\"\n$\\tilde{Q}'$ is clearly non-simply connected, as there are loops that can be formed around the center of the space which cannot possibly be deformed into a point. This envisioning is similar to the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]], in which the configuration space contains an infinitely high solenoid at the origin, preventing loops from closing.\n\n#+latex: {\\color{red}(I am unsure how to prove this rigourously, nor whether that would be necessary.

These don't follow from each other directly, but since the homotopy classes of both are identical I don't see much need to illustrate this in much detail})\n\nA rigorous derivation of the fundamental group of these spaces is highly non-trivial (see for instance cite:Fox1962 for the derivation of the 2D case). I will instead do the normal philospher of physics thing, namely to gesture at a proof which I belief will probably hold.\n\nThe only thing we need to show is that the $3D$ case is not different in any relevant  respect to the $2D$ one. In case of the fundamental group, the relevant respect is the number of [[file:20210427162825-homotopy_equivalent_paths.org][Homotopy equivalent paths]], the classes of paths which cannot be continuously deformed into one another. In a non-simply connected space, a path which winds around a \"hole\" cannot continuously be deformed into one which does not, nor can a path which winds around said hole twice be deformed into one that only winds around it once, or winds around it twice clockwise.\n\nLuckily for us, the  homotopy equivalent paths of  $\\tilde{Q}'$ are the same as those for $\\tilde{Q}$ , as all the paths that wind around the \"origin-hole\"  $k$ times can be continuously deformed into one another in both cases, and no other winding-sites exist. If our space would have additional holes, that could pose a problem, but for now we can rest easy.\n\nThus, since the number of homotopy classes is the same, the fundamental group is also identical, namely $B_N$ for $N$ particles. Therefore the $1D$ rep will remain the same, and the particles will not be limited to a phase of $0$  or $1$, and therefore anyons are possible.\n\n\n** Justifying the conditions\nWhile I will give some justification below, let us consider one line of argument: since (presumably) the configuration space just constructed allows for the existence of anyons, why do we not simply discard our previous idealization and insert this one into the EIA? Sure, it has some quirks, but the condition that particles cannot come within a certain distance of one another is hardly more problematic than assuming the particles cannot move in an entire dimension. The additional criterion of the wavefunction being zero outside the QH system similarly appears less restrictive than the 2D idealization. Can we then just assume that this is a strictly better model to use?\n\nUnfortunately, not quite.

However, many things are postulated in physics and never realized, so just being an idealization does not make it intersitng.\n   However, anyons are claimed to be observed [@Bartolomei2020]. How then do we square this?\n\n\nSome, like [@Shech2019], go even further and claim that these kinds of observations give indirect evidence for Platonism, making anyons even more intersting to look at.\n\nThe standard explanation of anyons is inherently /topological/. Topological explanation share something inherently in common with idealizations, and are thus extra worth looking at.\n\nWe can't directly talk about the failure of any particular idealization, only about a certain property. Anyons are interesting because the property is existence.\n\n\nHowever, to properly understand anyons, we need to look at the actual systems from which they come, which are things that look like the quantum hall effect. Otherwise we are simply examining the idealization on its own, rather than seeing whether the idealization corresponds to reality in any way (super-symmetry etc). Therefore, we should look at the FQHE to properly evaluate the status of anyons.\n\nFrom examining this, we see that the phase does not arise topologically in the description of the quantum hall effect (as you cannot really calculate things with that) but /geometrically/. Thus we will need to examine how geometric phase works and whether and how this could be related to the topology.\n\nThis discussion will then offer some inspiration for how such topological questions should be thought of.\n- Topological explanations are not uncommon in physics, example?.\n\n** New intro\n\n=Good line to introduce the chapter=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main subject of discussion here will be a new class of (quasi-)particles: anyons. In undergraduate courses, or, if you're lucky, highschool, we learn that two types of particles exist: fermions and bosons. These particles are distinguished by spin, half-integer and integer spin respectively. Anyons, as their name suggests, break this binary and are allowed /any/ type of spin, creating a whole new category of particle.[fn:4] While anyons are fascinating in their own right, we are interested in them because, according to the canon explanation, anyons are two-dimensional particles. More suggestively, the space they occupy cannot be /approximately/ $2D$, such as a $3D$ space of $1nm$ height, but /exactly/ two dimensional: a clear case of an infinite(simal) idealization. Of course, anyons would be just another plaything, were it not that, at the time of writing, anyons have rather strong empirical backing [@Bartolomei2020].\n\n\nAnother reason why anyons present such an interesting case, is that their explanation explicitly requires /topological/ arguments. Topological arguments, as I will show, show up in unexpected places and allow problematic idealizations to sneak in, as they smooth out many of the difficult to solve geometry. By tackling such an explicit use of topology in an infinite idealization, we will be able to use the argumentative structure in our general analysis of infinite idealizations. =The opposite of topology is geometry=\n\n[fn:4] Or an infinite number of new particle types, depending on one's preference.\n\n\n* Topology and Anyons\n\nIn a standard physics undergraduate program, you learn that there are two types of particles, fermions and bosons, which are distinguished by their spin, fermions coming in half-integer multiples $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} , ... )$ and bosons in integer multiples $(0, 1, 2, ...)$. A good starting question for understanding anyons would be: why /do/ we think there are only two types of particles? Why not $1$, or $3$, or infintely many? While many similar questions are as of yet unanswerable, such as why there appear to be only three generations of leptons (e.g. electrons, muons, tauons) or three fundamental forces in the standard model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), this one does have an accepted answer. It is, as always, a combination of experimental results and theory. Fermions and bosons' share few features besides the fact that they are particles, but the important commonality is that they are both /indistinguishable/ particles. Every electron is the exact same as every other electron, and every photon is perfectly identical to the next. There is no way to tell whether two fermions or two bosons have switched places when you weren't looking. We will explore the consequences of this in more detail later, but the important consequence of this fact is that it induces an overdescription of the physical situation: we can mathematically describe two situations, one in which we have electron $1$ on the left and electron $2$ on the left. While mathematically distinct, these situations are physically identical, and in order for our physics to make sense we need to account for this distinction. The reasons for assuming indistinguishability could be a thesis topic in its own right, and the above description does not attempt to do it justice. The important point is /how/ we arrive from this indistinguishability to the fact that there are two types of particles: how does indistinguishability help us distinguish particles, and how do we mathematically distinguish these identical states?\n\nAs a warm-up, let us consider a rather handwavey argument. Handwavey, because it relies on the particles still being distinguishable, but it illustrates the point. Say we start with a system $\\Psi_0$ of two particles, $x_1$ and $x_2$, each with their own probability distribution $\\psi_i$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)\\]\nNow, for our next trick, we will exchange the two particles, such that particle $x_1$ is in state $\\psi_a$ and particle $x_2$ is in state $\\psi_b$. If we suggestively take state $\\psi_i$ to be mean something like \"having probability $1$ of being found around $x=a$\", then this exchange can be the physical exchange of the two particles. Now, of course, we do not know which particle is which, so writing down the 1-exchange wave function would be getting ahead of ourselves, but we do know that if we were to exchange the particles once again we should regain our initial wavefunction $\\Psi_0$. To dentote this, we define an exchange operator $P$ which does just, and say that the wavefunction after exchanging twice (= rotating by 360 degrees) is $\\psi_{2\\pi}=P^2\\psi_0=1\\psi_0$. To find the wavefunction of the 1-exchang system, we find\n\\[\\psi_{\\pi}=P\\psi_0=\\sqrt{1}\\psi_0=\\pm 1\\psi_0\\]\n\nThis yields two possibilities for particles: those for with $P=-1$ and those for which $P=1$. The latter are bosons and the former are fermions.[fn:7]\n\n\n\n\nThe above argument is too handwavey, so we would like to make it more concrete. The way to define what we mean by \"exchange/ability/\". To start, the suggestively italicized /ability/ part of exchangeability hints at the fact that the /possible/ ways a particle /is able to be/ exchanged is of central importance. One natural way of defining this is by looking at all the possible paths the particle can take. We would need to look at the /configuration space/ of the particles: the possible configurations of them and connections between these configurations.[fn:8] Now we need to supplant this with a notion of what it means for two paths to be /the same/, or, equivalently, what it means for two paths to be different. This idea of path-similarity depends on which factors we judge relevant when considering manipulating quantum particles, which we need to choose if we wish to obtain the most general description possible. Like most of physics, we would not want our description to depend on some sort of absolute position or orientation in space, so our description better ignore those. Beyond that, however, identifying the relevant factors of the space becomes more tricky. The two most promising candidates are a /geometric/ or /topological/ notion of path similarity. As it turns out, the latter is used in the most commonly accepted explanation of anyons, the main reason being the mathematical and conceptual simplicity it brings.\n\nThe main notion of similarity used to explain anyons, namely the topological notion of /homotopy equivalence/, roughly means that two paths are the same if they can be continuously deformed into one another. This differs wildly from /geometric/ path equivalence: there paths are only \"the same\" if they traverse the same path in the same space, they need to be =isomorphic=. Consider the difference between a mountain ridge versus a nice meadow. Geometrically, the two are very different, and if we were to care about how exhausting a hike over that distance would be we would certainly not neglect to take those differences into consideration. On the other hand, if we were an amateur nautical cartographer interested in plotting out all bodies of water in the area, we would consider both spaces identically topologically: neither of them has any lakes. It is clear why a topological approach to particle paths would be attractive, as it massively simplifies the set of possibilities down to the bare essentials. It is clear that sometimes we do need to consider the relevant geometry however: our hiker will no doubt complain if their map-making friend confuses meadows for mountains, or vice versa depending on their constitution.\n\nReturning to anyons, we see that the approach taken for the /explanation/ turns out to be topological, while when actually calculating the phase we need to take into account the /geometry/. Here we will first discuss the topological argument, after which we will consider the prequisites for and the geometrical argument itself in Section 3 and 4.\n\nBy focussing on the homotopy notion of equivalent paths, we release ourselves from the burden of having to examine each individual path and instead are able to focus on features of the /space/. Specifically, since we only need whether two paths are continuously deformed into one another, we just need to look at whether the space allows for such trickyness. This feature of a space is called its *connectedness*. A space is called *simply connected* iff all /loops/ can be deformed into a point, like in figure ref:fig:connectedness. For our purposes, since we are looking at the position of a particle in spacetime, we can consider a space to be simply connected if it has no holes. Here a hole is a hole that \"pierces\" the space: the handle in the \"space\" of a coffeecup and the hole in the \"space\" of a donut are prime examples, while the inside of a bottle or a bubble in a glass of coke do not count as \"holes\" for the sake of connectedness. On the contrary, spaces with such holes are called /multiply-connected/, or sometimes more simply /non-simply-connected/ spaces.\n\nThis concept of connectedness allows us to understand the main assumption behind the handwavey argument above: we return to the same position after rotating 2\\pi if the space is simply connected, because \"being the same\" means \"being the same path\" and \"being the same path\" means \"being able to continuously deform them to each other\" and \"doing nothing\" is the \"point path\" and you are only able to shrink all paths to a point in a simply connected space. This, of course, raises the question: is the configuration space of two identical particles always simply connected, i.e., why do should we return to the same system after rotating $2\\pi$? As we will see, it is simply connected in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but /not/ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is why people say that anyons can only exist in 2D. As we will also see, however, is that this is not strictly true, as we can conceive of somewhat plausible multiply-connected 3D spaces.\n\n[fn:7] Note that this does not directly follow: it could also be the case that particles just sometimes have -1 and other times +1. Empirically, however, we find no such distinction, only dependent on particle type.\n\n[fn:8] The other framework for considering such exchange is in terms of exchanging all the relevant quantum numbers, effectively mathematically swapping the particles. We shall see that this does not work for defining anyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Phase\n\nMuch of the upcoming section will be centered around calculating the /phase/ of a quantum system, and it will be useful to briefly go over what we mean by phase and its relation to anyons. Briefly stated, the phase factor is a complex number which does not change the physical information if applied globally, that is when multiplying every wavefunction under consideration with it. The $\\pm1$ applied by our operator $P$ is such a phase.\nPhase arises because the empirical outcome of measuring a quantum state involves calculating the modulo-squared of the wavefunction. There are simply (at least) two wavefunctions which arrive at the same outcome if you square them with their complex conjugate: - that wavefunction and plus that wavefunction. They are both perfectly fine mathematical representations of the same state, just like the fact that the square root of 9 can be both -3 and 3. When asked: what is the length of the side of a square field of 9 square meters, the answer is indeterminate: it can be either 3 or -3. Rather than saying it can only be positive, we can be a bit more general and say that the \"phase factor\" in front of the three is unphysical: it simply does not matter for calculating the surface area of the field what  it is. We have, of course, some empirical preference for using positive lengths in stead of negative ones, but we do not such physical intuitions for wave functions, as they live in Hilbert Space and we unfortunately only have 4D spacetime to our disposal. Since wavefunctions live in /complex/ Hilbert space, the most general factor that would get $||^2$ away is not $\\pm 1$, but $e^{i\\theta}$, as that simply /is/ the square root of $1$ in $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus any wavefunction will show empirical differences when multiplied with $e^{i\\theta}\\quad\\forall\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\nIt is of course not immediately clear what this has to do with paths in configuration space or anyons for that fact. The answer is that, while systems could theoretically obtain any phase, they do not in general do so. We know from examining the time-dependent Schrodinger equation that it can be reduced to the time-/independent/ schrodinger equation times a phase factor, which depends on time and the energy of the system. However, while we said that phase does not matter physically, this is only the case for the system as a whole: if two systems have different phase they interfere. It's analogous measuring any other kind of wave: you will have to pick a starting point in order to describe the offset of a particular wave. These phases don't matter until you measure two waves interfering, which leads to inteference. For particles this leads to destructive interference for fermions: if the exact same wave would =xxxxxxxxxx= then there is probability zero of it being there. This is the Pauli-exclusion principle.\n\nThus while phases do not appear to matter /prima faciae/, they are the reason matter is able to exist in the first place! Without the Pauli Exclusion Principle it would not be possible for matter to clump together, as everything would simply phase through each other (barring electromagnetic interactions).\n\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]] :level 2\n\n\n** The configuration space explanation for anyons\n\nThe topological explanation gestured at above consists of roughly the following steps:\n1. Construct the /configuration space/ of the system, that is, all possible positions our particle pair could be in.\n2. Find all possible homotopy equivalent paths, and, by extension, the /fundamental group/ of the space.\n3. Derive the 1D-representation of that group, that is, a scalar representing that group. This is the phase-factor.\n\nWe will go through these steps in detail for the case of anyons and other particles. After showing that anyons appear to only be possible in 2D, we construct a toy 3D-configuration space in which anyons are also possible.\n\n\n*** The 3D case\n**** Constructing the configuration space\nOur first task is to construct the configuration space for the exchange of $N$ identical particles in $3D$, after which we will examine its topological properties. The most general configuration space we can construct is one for $N$ particles living in $d$ dimensions, which would be\n \n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbb{R}^d_1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_2 ... \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_N\n    \\label{eq:Ndconfig}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (1)$$\n\nWe shall for now focus on just two particles in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which would be the configuration space occupied by two $3$-dimensional vectors $(r_1, r_2)$ representing two particles\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3  \\]\nAs we are dealing with identical particles, however, we need to add some extra structure, which results in our configuration space being much smaller than the above.\n\nTo simplify our notation and avoid having to conceptualize $9$-dimensional space, we can define our configuration space in terms of the center of mass of the particles $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1+r_2})}{2}$ and their difference vector $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r_1-r_2}$. Clearly the configuration space of $(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r})$ is still $\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. However, now we can pull a trick. We only care about exchanging the particles, right? It seems reasonable, therefore, that the position of the system as a whole does not play in a role in determining all possible positions of the particle, e.g. it should not matter (we assume, quite reasonably) whether we exchange two fermions in our lab on Earth or on Venus. For our purposes, then, we can safely ignore one of the two $\\mathbb{R}^3$s and simply focus on the relative distance and orientation of the two particles with each other.[fn:9] This simplifies the problem of finding the configuration space significantly.\n\nLet us return to the constraints. The first constraint is the indistinguishability of the particles. Since it is impossible to distinguish the situation $(r_1,r_2)$ from $(r_2,r_1)$, we cannot take these two configurations to be separate points in configuration space and must remove them. We can represent this by \"dividing out\" the permutation group $S_2$ from our current configuration space,[fn:10] yielding\n\\[\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^3 }{S_2}\\]\n\nThe second and final constraint is accounting for particles not being able to intersect with each other. The argument for /why/ we ought to, however, is rarely made precise. The general tendency, as by\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n[fn:9] Another way of thinking about this is to consider one particle to be fixed and the other moving around it.\n\n[fn:10] This makes it somewhat difficult to visually relate the \"one particle standing still\" picture to what the configuration space actually represents. Roughly, you can imagine it as the \"moving\" particle returning back to its original position after a rotation of $\\pi$ radians.\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect\n\nSo, anyons are claimed to be observed in 2D only.\nHowever, some claim that anyons are observed [@Bartolomei2020]  in actual systems. Does this mean that those systems are /actually/ two dimensional? This would go against much of our general intuition about systems.\n- Physisists claim that these systems are /approximatley/ or /effectively/ 2D (=sources=).\n- Following [@Norton2012], we know how to interpret this: we can demote an idealization to an approximation if we are able to show that there is a smooth limit.\n- This is exactly the problem, according to [@Shech2019]: the topological explanation of anyons requires an /exact/ 2D system (or a rather ad-hoc 2D system as we saw).\n- Therefore we cannot call this approximately 2D.\n- According to [@Shech2019], this is a problem for those with nominalist inclinations[fn:1], as the instantiation of abstract mathematical structures in the real world would be an issue.\n  - Such an argument can only be made, however, through the use of the EIA which was discussed in the previous (or next?) chapter.\n- Therefore, it would do such people well to examine the physical effect thoroughly for any signs of this.\n\n\n\nLuckily, hope is on the horizon: it turns out that the computations of the phase of the alledged anyons in the FQHE uses a geometrical notion rather than a topological notion of phase.\n- Unluckily, this geometrical notion also relies on a two dimensional idealization.\n- However, this idealization /could/ conceivably be demoted to an approximation.\n\nIn this chapter, we will examine the inner working of the Quantum Hall Effect. This is needed in order to understand the following\n1. Why do people say that these particles are anyons\n2. What idealizations are made in the explanation of the quantum hall effect separate from the topological one.\n3. ...\n\nReaders less interested in the details can skip to the last subsection of this section =link= and the next section =link=.\n\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect is the quantum version of the classical hall effect, a rather straightforward consequence of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. It was discovered all the way back in =XXXX= by Edwin Hall, who claimed it a novelty which would never have any use-case. Today Hall-Effect sensors are widely used to pick up magnetic fields and rotations of conducting materials. More esoteric applications are as potential long-term space-travel propellants in so-called Hall-Effect thrusters, which are a specific form of ion propolsion, which can generate a low thrust for a very long amount of time.\n\nThe basics of the effect are rather simple\n- Strip which has current flowing through it.\n- Magnetic field perpendicular to that strip\n- Induces Lorentz force which pushes particles to one side, increasing their concentration and creating a potential difference, inducing a voltage changing the resistivity.\n- This resistivity linearly depends on the voltage, which linearly depends on the concentration difference which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field, thus yielding a linear dependence of the resistivity to the strenght of the perpendicular magnetic field.\n- Looks like figure ref:fig:che\n\nHowever, as most classical effects, they only hold in a certain regime. When we clean up the materials, lower the temperature dramatically (<2K) and increase the magnetic field strength considerably, we observe the /Quantum Hall Effect/ (QHE): rather than a linear dependence on the magnetic field strength, the resistivity shows these strange plateaux at rather consistent values, as in ref:fig:qhe. The spacing between these plateaux does not seem to differ between different materials, which is even more curious.\n\nSo: why? Why do we see these plateaux, and why at these levels? The short answer (partially) is: the impurities in the sample lift the degeneracy of the eigenstates of the Quantum Hall system, called Landau levels, and /localizes/ some of those states, rather than the states extending from one edge of the sample to the other (akin to the wavefunctions of a particle in a box). These localized states do not conduct current (as do not span the system, and resistivity is measured from end to end), thus leading to the plateaux in the resistivity: we change plateaux when all the localized states are filled and we move to different extended states. The specific values of these levels depend on weird physics at the boundaries of the system called /edge-modes/, but in short the levels correspond to the number of filled Landau levels: at higher magnetic field strengths the levels can accommodate more states, thus the lower the magnetic field strength the larger the number of available levels, leading to a smooth-looking linear dependence in the classical regime.\n\nThere are quite some caveats to the above story, but that is the gist of why the effect happens for /integer levels/. The less interested reader can skip over the following section describing the corresponding /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/ (IQHE) and head to the description of its fractional cousin, where the same does not hold. Specifically, the IQHE requires one massive idealization: electron interaction is neglected completely. As we shall see, this idealization cannot hold in the FQHE.\n\n[fn:1] If the reader was not aware of this yet, the author does hold such inclinations.\n\n** The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\nIn order to do as little physics as is possibly required, I will skip most of the justification for the quantum formalism of the QHE (quantizing the classical Hamiltonian, finding the commutators) and many of the intermediate steps to arrive at the relevant results. I point the interested reader to [@Tong2016][[]] for a quite accessible and to [@Arovas2020] for a more thorough pedagogical discussion of these issues, and to [@Stone1992; @Prange1987; @Doucot2005] for rather complete, less pedagogical sources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) is the observation of plateaux in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ at regular intervals. These intervals happen to be integer multiples of the /quantum of resistance/  $R_q=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2}$. =check whether this is so=\n- This is rather curious, why so precise?\n- In fact, so precise that these experiments are used to determine the quantum of resistance.\n- Why are they there, and why at those levels?\n\nAs physicists, the first thought as to the origin of these plateaux probably goes to the energy eigenstates of the system, which turns out to be correct! The plateaux correspond to the general energy eigenstates of a system of charged particles moving in a perpendicular magnetic field, so called Landau levels.\n- It will be difficult to properly understand the QHE without first briefly going over landau levels.\n\n=Assumptions=\n\n*** Landau Levels\n\nHere we already start to sneak in our idealizations: we will treat this system as if it is two dimensional. =However, this system can be easily extended to 3D, see XXXX=\n\nThe simplest Hamiltonian for a system of particles moving in a magnetic field is\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2} m(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} +e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} )^2\n    \\label{eq:landauham}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (2)$$\n\nThe  magnetic field is perpendicular to the $x,y$-plane, so we define the vector potential $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}$ using our knowledge that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane $\\nabla\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=B \\hat{z}$, to be\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\nxB\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n    \\label{eq:landaugauge}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (3)$$\n\n=This will be appendix=\nThe easiest way to find the energy eigenstates is the way all Hamiltonians get solved: treat is as the harmonic oscillator. As the Hamiltonian of the \"normal\" harmonic oscillator is\n\n\n..\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x - i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for $\\pi$ then tell us that $a$ and $a^\\dagger$ obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n\\[H= \\frac{1}{2}m \\pi^2   = \\omega_B \\left( a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2}  \\right)\\]\nWe find that the energy eigenlevels are\n\\[\\ket{n}=\\omega_B\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\n*** Calculating the degeneracy\n\nWe started by saying that the plateaux in the IQHE correspond to the various filled Landau levels of the simple particle in a magnetic field system. We still need to prove this, namely by deriving the conductivity for the Hall states. This can get rather messy, so I will show put the derivation for a single particle here, and the more general derivation of the so called /Kubo formula/ in the Appendix.\n\n=sloppy=\n\nTo find the resistivity, we use Ohm's law, which relates the energy of a particle to the current density (current over area)\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{E}=\\sigma \\mathbf{J}\n    \\label{eq:ohm}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (4)$$\n\nOur mechanical momentum is\n\\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} = m \\hat{\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}}\\]\nClassically, the current (for a single particle) is simply $\\mathbf{I}=-e\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}$, but isnce we are working quantum mechanically we take the expectation value\n\n\\[I=-e/m \\sum_filled_states \\bra{\\psi}-i\\hbar\\nabla+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\ket{\\psi} \\]\n\nWe are working in Landau gauge.\n\n...\n\nWe end up with\n*** Edge modes\n\nIn order to provide a more thorough calculation (i.e. not just considering a single electron) we take advantage of a the fact that the system is bounded. I will not reproduce this here.\n\n\n*** Robutsness\n\nThe explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\nThis is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness.\n\nExperimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Figure 1: <<fig:disorder>>Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:disorder\n[[file:./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n#+caption: Figure 2: <<fig:extended>>Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:extended\n[[file:./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (5)$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    | \\Delta V | <<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} |\n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (6)$$\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.=\n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=.\n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see [@Tong2016]\n\n\nThat is it for the IQHE, as we derived the two things we needed from it: we gained a general understanding of why the plateaux have their values (they are the energy eigenvalues of the Landau levels) and, more importantly, we roughly understand why these plateaux are robust.\nUnfortunately, this is not the end of the story, we did not even mention anything topological yet! For that we finally turn to the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.\n\n[fn:5] Improved performance of impure 2D materials is an active area of research in material science, see [@Wang2020] for a summary of how impurities enhance the conductivity of graphene.\n\n[fn:6] The non-dirty sample just discussed is a great example of taking an idealization too seriously: we cannot explain the phenomena in the idealized setting, and have to retrofit extra physics on top of the idealization in order to get a satisfying explanation, only for us to then show in the limit of no impurities we regain our initial idealization. If this limit would not have been smooth (it fortunately is), we would have wasted all this time!\n\n\n** The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nFollowing the naming convention of the IQHE, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) refers to the observation of plateaux at /fractional/ values of the quantum of resistance in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$. Sadly, very few of the arguments mentioned above will be able to explain these plateaux, as we have only shown that they appear at fully filled Landau levels. However, our intuition about the robustness will still hold.\n\n\nThe goal of this expos\\'e is twofold. First we want to gain a general understanding of how the FQHE is thought about in general: what assumptions go into calculating the relevant parameters, which idealizations are noteworthy, etc. The other main goal is the 'derivation' of the Laughlin wavefunction, the wavefunction used to describe the FQH system, and its excitations. At the end we will arrive at the problem of calculating the exchange statistics of these excitations, which turn out to be /anyons/, but not actually compute them yet: this will be done in section ref:sec:GeometricPhase.\n\n\nThe key difference between the description of the Fractional as opposed to the Integer Quantum Hall effect is the inclusion of electron interactions in the former, which becomes impossible to ignore at the energy scales above $\\nu=1$, which is where most of the FQHE physics is done. As a result the reasoning cannot be as rigorous as before. In the IQHE we could pretend that all the states occupied the same Landau level, which allowed us to calculate the wavefunctions and energy levels, leading to the derivation of the Hall resistivity and confirm our suspicion that the plateaux correspond to fully filled Landau levels. Only after doing that did we let go of that idealization and allow the degeneracy to be lifted in order to argue that the plateaux were robust.\n\nThis order of operation is no longer possible in the FQHE, as the electron interactions lift the degeneracy of the Landau levels from the start, forcing us to compute the wavefunctions in a different way. A first approach would be to use perturbation theory: model the electron interaction as a small perturbation to ref:eq:landauham and then gradually compute a better and better approximation to the actual wavefunction. While this is fine for simple two-electron systems, the number of electrons in a QH system is closer to $10^{23}$. That is a rather large matrix to diagonalize, not even close to possible to do numerically. Therefore, we need to pull some tricks.\n\nThe trick is: do not compute the wave function, just write one down. That is exactly what [@Laughlin1983] did, yielding what we now call the *Laughlin wavefunction*\n\n[[file:20210311182300-the_laughlin_wavefunction.org][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]\n\nLaughlin of course did not just simply write down a bunch of wavefunction and pick the one he liked best, it is motivated by some observations from the system and from some general conditions we have to place on any wavefunction. Specifically, in a previous paper [@Laughlin1983a] he derived the wavefunctions for three particles in the FQHE. Recapping this in the case of two electrons is worthwhile.\n\nWe have a system of two electrons with a potential $V(|r_1-r_2|)$.\n- To solve such systems, it's easiest to work with angular momentum.\n- If we want to work with angular momentum, the gauge we picked before (Landau Gauge) is not very useful, as it does not include any kind of rotation\n  - Instead we pick /symmetric gauge/, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\times \\mathbf{B}= -yB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + xB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n- Skipping multiple steps ahead, we see that the wavefunctions look like\n\nUnfortunately this does not uniquely or straightforwardly generalize to N particles, so we have to pull a few more tricks.\n1. We do try to generalize, and say that a wavefunction for N particles will look something like $f(z)e^{something}$\n2. We /insist/ that the wavefunction be in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) it can possibly be: there are no other Landau levels it can fall back on. This is rather strong. This leads to the claim that $f(z)$ /must/ be analytic. =how=\n3. Since the state will have to describe fermions, the wave function must be anti-symmetric under exchange of the particles, which requires $f(z)$ to be odd.\n4. Finally, since we need to conserve angular momentum, we require that =f(z) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree M, where M is the total angular momentum.=\n\nAll these constraints add up to the fact that $f(z)=\\prod_{j<k}(z_j-z_k)^m$, with $m$ odd.\n*This is what people mean when they say that the LWF falls into the same universality class as the actual wavefunction, as any wavefunction needs to account for this.[fn:3]*\n\nWell, neat, you might say, but this still just describes fermions, I thought we were going to be talking about anyons! Right you are, things only really get exciting once we start talking about /excitations/ of this ground state.\n\n- The excitations of the FQH state (technically of the state described by the Laughlin wavefunction, which are not exactly alike)\n\n[fn:3] The LWF might appear to just be an easy to compute with exemplar of this universality class, but it actually has some other nice features which set it apart from its siblings, see =other nice feature of LWF=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Phase\n\n* Unresolved Issues\n\n** What is the importance of the 2D idealization for the FQHE\nThe quantum hall effect has also been studied in three dimensions, see [@Torres2020; @Tang2019; @Pavlosiuk2017].\n\nApparently it is not as straightforward as I thought, people have constructed the 3D fractional quantum hall effect, but it's rather difficult.\n\nThe difference-maker for whether an electron gas is 2D seems to be it's Fermi-surface topology.\n[[file:20210601145016-3d_quantum_hall_effect.org][3D Quantum Hall Effect]]\n* Citations I still need to use\n\n[@Shech2015b]\n\n[@Wilczek1982]\n\n[@Rao2001]\n\n[@Knapp2016]\n\n\\printbibliography\n","added":true,"removed":false}],"additions":6464,"deletions":0}],"additions":6464,"deletions":0},{"oid":"3d785838eec18dd1e7c8abc5f94e3ffca62ac0ba","message":"Scripted auto-commit on change (2021-06-08 16:42:45) by gitwatch.sh\n","date":1623163365,"files":[{"filepath":"20210528160149-outline_anyons.tmp6aVMYQ.org","oid":"d6273c20f0d269e19f2f0c96c0612ad4ad8775e3","diff":[{"count":860,"value":"# Created 2021-06-07 Mon 22:59\n#+TITLE: Outline Anyons\n#+AUTHOR: Thomas F.

However, many things are postulated in physics and never realized, so just being an idealization does not make it intersitng.\n   However, anyons are claimed to be observed [@Bartolomei2020]. How then do we square this?\n\n\nSome, like [@Shech2019], go even further and claim that these kinds of observations give indirect evidence for Platonism, making anyons even more intersting to look at.\n\nThe standard explanation of anyons is inherently /topological/. Topological explanation share something inherently in common with idealizations, and are thus extra worth looking at.\n\nWe can't directly talk about the failure of any particular idealization, only about a certain property. Anyons are interesting because the property is existence.\n\n\nHowever, to properly understand anyons, we need to look at the actual systems from which they come, which are things that look like the quantum hall effect. Otherwise we are simply examining the idealization on its own, rather than seeing whether the idealization corresponds to reality in any way (super-symmetry etc). Therefore, we should look at the FQHE to properly evaluate the status of anyons.\n\nFrom examining this, we see that the phase does not arise topologically in the description of the quantum hall effect (as you cannot really calculate things with that) but /geometrically/. Thus we will need to examine how geometric phase works and whether and how this could be related to the topology.\n\nThis discussion will then offer some inspiration for how such topological questions should be thought of.\n- Topological explanations are not uncommon in physics, example?.\n\n** New intro\n\n=Good line to introduce the chapter=\n\n\n"},{"count":6,"removed":true,"value":"\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"count":518,"value":"The main subject of discussion here will be a new class of (quasi-)particles: anyons. In undergraduate courses, or, if you're lucky, highschool, we learn that two types of particles exist: fermions and bosons. These particles are distinguished by spin, half-integer and integer spin respectively. Anyons, as their name suggests, break this binary and are allowed /any/ type of spin, creating a whole new category of particle.[fn:4] While anyons are fascinating in their own right, we are interested in them because, according to the canon explanation, anyons are two-dimensional particles. More suggestively, the space they occupy cannot be /approximately/ $2D$, such as a $3D$ space of $1nm$ height, but /exactly/ two dimensional: a clear case of an infinite(simal) idealization. Of course, anyons would be just another plaything, were it not that, at the time of writing, anyons have rather strong empirical backing [@Bartolomei2020].\n\n\nAnother reason why anyons present such an interesting case, is that their explanation explicitly requires /topological/ arguments. Topological arguments, as I will show, show up in unexpected places and allow problematic idealizations to sneak in, as they smooth out many of the difficult to solve geometry.

A good starting question for understanding anyons would be: why /do/ we think there are only two types of particles? Why not $1$, or $3$, or infintely many? While many similar questions are as of yet unanswerable, such as why there appear to be only three generations of leptons (e.g. electrons, muons, tauons) or three fundamental forces in the standard model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), this one does have an accepted answer. It is, as always, a combination of experimental results and theory. Fermions and bosons' share few features besides the fact that they are particles, but the important commonality is that they are both /indistinguishable/ particles. Every electron is the exact same as every other electron, and every photon is perfectly identical to the next. There is no way to tell whether two fermions or two bosons have switched places when you weren't looking. We will explore the consequences of this in more detail later, but the important consequence of this fact is that it induces an overdescription of the physical situation: we can mathematically describe two situations, one in which we have electron $1$ on the left and electron $2$ on the left. While mathematically distinct, these situations are physically identical, and in order for our physics to make sense we need to account for this distinction. The reasons for assuming indistinguishability could be a thesis topic in its own right, and the above description does not attempt to do it justice. The important point is /how/ we arrive from this indistinguishability to the fact that there are two types of particles: how does indistinguishability help us distinguish particles, and how do we mathematically distinguish these identical states?\n\nAs a warm-up, let us consider a rather handwavey argument. Handwavey, because it relies on the particles still being distinguishable, but it illustrates the point. Say we start with a system $\\Psi_0$ of two particles, $x_1$ and $x_2$, each with their own probability distribution $\\psi_i$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)\\]\nNow, for our next trick, we will exchange the two particles, such that particle $x_1$ is in state $\\psi_a$ and particle $x_2$ is in state $\\psi_b$. If we suggestively take state $\\psi_i$ to be mean something like \"having probability $1$ of being found around $x=a$\", then this exchange can be the physical exchange of the two particles. Now, of course, we do not know which particle is which, so writing down the 1-exchange wave function would be getting ahead of ourselves, but we do know that if we were to exchange the particles once again we should regain our initial wavefunction $\\Psi_0$. To dentote this, we define an exchange operator $P$ which does just, and say that the wavefunction after exchanging twice (= rotating by 360 degrees) is $\\psi_{2\\pi}=P^2\\psi_0=1\\psi_0$. To find the wavefunction of the 1-exchang system, we find\n\\[\\psi_{\\pi}=P\\psi_0=\\sqrt{1}\\psi_0=\\pm 1\\psi_0\\]\n\nThis yields two possibilities for particles: those for with $P=-1$ and those for which $P=1$. The latter are bosons and the former are fermions.[fn:7]\n\n\n\n\nThe above argument is too handwavey, so we would like to make it more concrete. The way to define what we mean by \"exchange/ability/\". To start, the suggestively italicized /ability/ part of exchangeability hints at the fact that the /possible/ ways a particle /is able to be/ exchanged is of central importance. One natural way of defining this is by looking at all the possible paths the particle can take. We would need to look at the /configuration space/ of the particles: the possible configurations of them and connections between these configurations.[fn:8] Now we need to supplant this with a notion of what it means for two paths to be /the same/, or, equivalently, what it means for two paths to be different. This idea of path-similarity depends on which factors we judge relevant when considering manipulating quantum particles, which we need to choose if we wish to obtain the most general description possible. Like most of physics, we would not want our description to depend on some sort of absolute position or orientation in space, so our description better ignore those. Beyond that, however, identifying the relevant factors of the space becomes more tricky. The two most promising candidates are a /geometric/ or /topological/ notion of path similarity. As it turns out, the latter is used in the most commonly accepted explanation of anyons, the main reason being the mathematical and conceptual simplicity it brings.\n\nThe main notion of similarity used to explain anyons, namely the topological notion of /homotopy equivalence/, roughly means that two paths are the same if they can be continuously deformed into one another. This differs wildly from /geometric/ path equivalence: there paths are only \"the same\" if they traverse the same path in the same space, they need to be =isomorphic=. Consider the difference between a mountain ridge versus a nice meadow. Geometrically, the two are very different, and if we were to care about how exhausting a hike over that distance would be we would certainly not neglect to take those differences into consideration. On the other hand, if we were an amateur nautical cartographer interested in plotting out all bodies of water in the area, we would consider both spaces identically topologically: neither of them has any lakes. It is clear why a topological approach to particle paths would be attractive, as it massively simplifies the set of possibilities down to the bare essentials. It is clear that sometimes we do need to consider the relevant geometry however: our hiker will no doubt complain if their map-making friend confuses meadows for mountains, or vice versa depending on their constitution.\n\nReturning to anyons, we see that the approach taken for the /explanation/ turns out to be topological, while when actually calculating the phase we need to take into account the /geometry/. Here we will first discuss the topological argument, after which we will consider the prequisites for and the geometrical argument itself in Section 3 and 4.\n\nBy focussing on the homotopy notion of equivalent paths, we release ourselves from the burden of having to examine each individual path and instead are able to focus on features of the /space/. Specifically, since we only need whether two paths are continuously deformed into one another, we just need to look at whether the space allows for such trickyness. This feature of a space is called its *connectedness*. A space is called *simply connected* iff all /loops/ can be deformed into a point, like in figure ref:fig:connectedness. For our purposes, since we are looking at the position of a particle in spacetime, we can consider a space to be simply connected if it has no holes. Here a hole is a hole that \"pierces\" the space: the handle in the \"space\" of a coffeecup and the hole in the \"space\" of a donut are prime examples, while the inside of a bottle or a bubble in a glass of coke do not count as \"holes\" for the sake of connectedness. On the contrary, spaces with such holes are called /multiply-connected/, or sometimes more simply /non-simply-connected/ spaces.\n\nThis concept of connectedness allows us to understand the main assumption behind the handwavey argument above: we return to the same position after rotating 2\\pi if the space is simply connected, because \"being the same\" means \"being the same path\" and \"being the same path\" means \"being able to continuously deform them to each other\" and \"doing nothing\" is the \"point path\" and you are only able to shrink all paths to a point in a simply connected space. This, of course, raises the question: is the configuration space of two identical particles always simply connected, i.e., why do should we return to the same system after rotating $2\\pi$? As we will see, it is simply connected in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but /not/ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is why people say that anyons can only exist in 2D. As we will also see, however, is that this is not strictly true, as we can conceive of somewhat plausible multiply-connected 3D spaces.\n\n[fn:7] Note that this does not directly follow: it could also be the case that particles just sometimes have -1 and other times +1. Empirically, however, we find no such distinction, only dependent on particle type.\n\n[fn:8] The other framework for considering such exchange is in terms of exchanging all the relevant quantum numbers, effectively mathematically swapping the particles. We shall see that this does not work for defining anyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Phase\n\nMuch of the upcoming section will be centered around calculating the /phase/ of a quantum system, and it will be useful to briefly go over what we mean by phase and its relation to anyons. Briefly stated, the phase factor is a complex number which does not change the physical information if applied globally, that is when multiplying every wavefunction under consideration with it. The $\\pm1$ applied by our operator $P$ is such a phase.\nPhase arises because the empirical outcome of measuring a quantum state involves calculating the modulo-squared of the wavefunction. There are simply (at least) two wavefunctions which arrive at the same outcome if you square them with their complex conjugate: - that wavefunction and plus that wavefunction. They are both perfectly fine mathematical representations of the same state, just like the fact that the square root of 9 can be both -3 and 3. When asked: what is the length of the side of a square field of 9 square meters, the answer is indeterminate: it can be either 3 or -3. Rather than saying it can only be positive, we can be a bit more general and say that the \"phase factor\" in front of the three is unphysical: it simply does not matter for calculating the surface area of the field what  it is. We have, of course, some empirical preference for using positive lengths in stead of negative ones, but we do not such physical intuitions for wave functions, as they live in Hilbert Space and we unfortunately only have 4D spacetime to our disposal. Since wavefunctions live in /complex/ Hilbert space, the most general factor that would get $||^2$ away is not $\\pm 1$, but $e^{i\\theta}$, as that simply /is/ the square root of $1$ in $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus any wavefunction will show empirical differences when multiplied with $e^{i\\theta}\\quad\\forall\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\nIt is of course not immediately clear what this has to do with paths in configuration space or anyons for that fact. The answer is that, while systems could theoretically obtain any phase, they do not in general do so. We know from examining the time-dependent Schrodinger equation that it can be reduced to the time-/independent/ schrodinger equation times a phase factor, which depends on time and the energy of the system. However, while we said that phase does not matter physically, this is only the case for the system as a whole: if two systems have different phase they interfere. It's analogous measuring any other kind of wave: you will have to pick a starting point in order to describe the offset of a particular wave. These phases don't matter until you measure two waves interfering, which leads to inteference. For particles this leads to destructive interference for fermions: if the exact same wave would =xxxxxxxxxx= then there is probability zero of it being there. This is the Pauli-exclusion principle.\n\nThus while phases do not appear to matter /prima faciae/, they are the reason matter is able to exist in the first place! Without the Pauli Exclusion Principle it would not be possible for matter to clump together, as everything would simply phase through each other (barring electromagnetic interactions).\n\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]] :level 2\n\n\n** The configuration space explanation for anyons\n\nThe topological explanation gestured at above consists of roughly the following steps:\n1. Construct the /configuration space/ of the system, that is, all possible positions our particle pair could be in.\n2. Find all possible homotopy equivalent paths, and, by extension, the /fundamental group/ of the space.\n3. Derive the 1D-representation of that group, that is, a scalar representing that group. This is the phase-factor.\n\nWe will go through these steps in detail for the case of anyons and other particles. After showing that anyons appear to only be possible in 2D, we construct a toy 3D-configuration space in which anyons are also possible.\n\n\n*** The 3D case\n**** Constructing the configuration space\nOur first task is to construct the configuration space for the exchange of $N$ identical particles in $3D$, after which we will examine its topological properties. The most general configuration space we can construct is one for $N$ particles living in $d$ dimensions, which would be\n \n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbb{R}^d_1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_2 ... \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_N\n    \\label{eq:Ndconfig}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (1)$$\n\nWe shall for now focus on just two particles in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which would be the configuration space occupied by two $3$-dimensional vectors $(r_1, r_2)$ representing two particles\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3  \\]\nAs we are dealing with identical particles, however, we need to add some extra structure, which results in our configuration space being much smaller than the above.\n\nTo simplify our notation and avoid having to conceptualize $9$-dimensional space, we can define our configuration space in terms of the center of mass of the particles $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1+r_2})}{2}$ and their difference vector $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r_1-r_2}$. Clearly the configuration space of $(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r})$ is still $\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. However, now we can pull a trick. We only care about exchanging the particles, right? It seems reasonable, therefore, that the position of the system as a whole does not play in a role in determining all possible positions of the particle, e.g. it should not matter (we assume, quite reasonably) whether we exchange two fermions in our lab on Earth or on Venus. For our purposes, then, we can safely ignore one of the two $\\mathbb{R}^3$s and simply focus on the relative distance and orientation of the two particles with each other.[fn:9] This simplifies the problem of finding the configuration space significantly.\n\nLet us return to the constraints. The first constraint is the indistinguishability of the particles. Since it is impossible to distinguish the situation $(r_1,r_2)$ from $(r_2,r_1)$, we cannot take these two configurations to be separate points in configuration space and must remove them. We can represent this by \"dividing out\" the permutation group $S_2$ from our current configuration space,[fn:10] yielding\n\\[\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^3 }{S_2}\\]\n\nThe second and final constraint is accounting for particles not being able to intersect with each other. The argument for /why/ we ought to, however, is rarely made precise. The general tendency, as by\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n[fn:9] Another way of thinking about this is to consider one particle to be fixed and the other moving around it.\n\n[fn:10] This makes it somewhat difficult to visually relate the \"one particle standing still\" picture to what the configuration space actually represents. Roughly, you can imagine it as the \"moving\" particle returning back to its original position after a rotation of $\\pi$ radians.\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect\n\nSo, anyons are claimed to be observed in 2D only.\nHowever, some claim that anyons are observed [@Bartolomei2020]  in actual systems. Does this mean that those systems are /actually/ two dimensional? This would go against much of our general intuition about systems.\n- Physisists claim that these systems are /approximatley/ or /effectively/ 2D (=sources=).\n- Following [@Norton2012], we know how to interpret this: we can demote an idealization to an approximation if we are able to show that there is a smooth limit.\n- This is exactly the problem, according to [@Shech2019]: the topological explanation of anyons requires an /exact/ 2D system (or a rather ad-hoc 2D system as we saw).\n- Therefore we cannot call this approximately 2D.\n- According to [@Shech2019], this is a problem for those with nominalist inclinations[fn:1], as the instantiation of abstract mathematical structures in the real world would be an issue.\n  - Such an argument can only be made, however, through the use of the EIA which was discussed in the previous (or next?) chapter.\n- Therefore, it would do such people well to examine the physical effect thoroughly for any signs of this.\n\n\n\nLuckily, hope is on the horizon: it turns out that the computations of the phase of the alledged anyons in the FQHE uses a geometrical notion rather than a topological notion of phase.\n- Unluckily, this geometrical notion also relies on a two dimensional idealization.\n- However, this idealization /could/ conceivably be demoted to an approximation.\n\nIn this chapter, we will examine the inner working of the Quantum Hall Effect. This is needed in order to understand the following\n1. Why do people say that these particles are anyons\n2. What idealizations are made in the explanation of the quantum hall effect separate from the topological one.\n3. ...\n\nReaders less interested in the details can skip to the last subsection of this section =link= and the next section =link=.\n\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect is the quantum version of the classical hall effect, a rather straightforward consequence of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. It was discovered all the way back in =XXXX= by Edwin Hall, who claimed it a novelty which would never have any use-case. Today Hall-Effect sensors are widely used to pick up magnetic fields and rotations of conducting materials. More esoteric applications are as potential long-term space-travel propellants in so-called Hall-Effect thrusters, which are a specific form of ion propolsion, which can generate a low thrust for a very long amount of time.\n\nThe basics of the effect are rather simple\n- Strip which has current flowing through it.\n- Magnetic field perpendicular to that strip\n- Induces Lorentz force which pushes particles to one side, increasing their concentration and creating a potential difference, inducing a voltage changing the resistivity.\n- This resistivity linearly depends on the voltage, which linearly depends on the concentration difference which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field, thus yielding a linear dependence of the resistivity to the strenght of the perpendicular magnetic field.\n- Looks like figure ref:fig:che\n\nHowever, as most classical effects, they only hold in a certain regime. When we clean up the materials, lower the temperature dramatically (<2K) and increase the magnetic field strength considerably, we observe the /Quantum Hall Effect/ (QHE): rather than a linear dependence on the magnetic field strength, the resistivity shows these strange plateaux at rather consistent values, as in ref:fig:qhe. The spacing between these plateaux does not seem to differ between different materials, which is even more curious.\n\nSo: why? Why do we see these plateaux, and why at these levels? The short answer (partially) is: the impurities in the sample lift the degeneracy of the eigenstates of the Quantum Hall system, called Landau levels, and /localizes/ some of those states, rather than the states extending from one edge of the sample to the other (akin to the wavefunctions of a particle in a box). These localized states do not conduct current (as do not span the system, and resistivity is measured from end to end), thus leading to the plateaux in the resistivity: we change plateaux when all the localized states are filled and we move to different extended states. The specific values of these levels depend on weird physics at the boundaries of the system called /edge-modes/, but in short the levels correspond to the number of filled Landau levels: at higher magnetic field strengths the levels can accommodate more states, thus the lower the magnetic field strength the larger the number of available levels, leading to a smooth-looking linear dependence in the classical regime.\n\nThere are quite some caveats to the above story, but that is the gist of why the effect happens for /integer levels/. The less interested reader can skip over the following section describing the corresponding /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/ (IQHE) and head to the description of its fractional cousin, where the same does not hold. Specifically, the IQHE requires one massive idealization: electron interaction is neglected completely. As we shall see, this idealization cannot hold in the FQHE.\n\n[fn:1] If the reader was not aware of this yet, the author does hold such inclinations.\n\n** The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\nIn order to do as little physics as is possibly required, I will skip most of the justification for the quantum formalism of the QHE (quantizing the classical Hamiltonian, finding the commutators) and many of the intermediate steps to arrive at the relevant results. I point the interested reader to [@Tong2016][[]] for a quite accessible and to [@Arovas2020] for a more thorough pedagogical discussion of these issues, and to [@Stone1992; @Prange1987; @Doucot2005] for rather complete, less pedagogical sources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) is the observation of plateaux in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ at regular intervals. These intervals happen to be integer multiples of the /quantum of resistance/  $R_q=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2}$. =check whether this is so=\n- This is rather curious, why so precise?\n- In fact, so precise that these experiments are used to determine the quantum of resistance.\n- Why are they there, and why at those levels?\n\nAs physicists, the first thought as to the origin of these plateaux probably goes to the energy eigenstates of the system, which turns out to be correct! The plateaux correspond to the general energy eigenstates of a system of charged particles moving in a perpendicular magnetic field, so called Landau levels.\n- It will be difficult to properly understand the QHE without first briefly going over landau levels.\n\n=Assumptions=\n\n*** Landau Levels\n\nHere we already start to sneak in our idealizations: we will treat this system as if it is two dimensional. =However, this system can be easily extended to 3D, see XXXX=\n\nThe simplest Hamiltonian for a system of particles moving in a magnetic field is\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2} m(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} +e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} )^2\n    \\label{eq:landauham}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (2)$$\n\nThe  magnetic field is perpendicular to the $x,y$-plane, so we define the vector potential $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}$ using our knowledge that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane $\\nabla\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=B \\hat{z}$, to be\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\nxB\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n    \\label{eq:landaugauge}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (3)$$\n\n=This will be appendix=\nThe easiest way to find the energy eigenstates is the way all Hamiltonians get solved: treat is as the harmonic oscillator. As the Hamiltonian of the \"normal\" harmonic oscillator is\n\n\n..\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x - i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for $\\pi$ then tell us that $a$ and $a^\\dagger$ obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n\\[H= \\frac{1}{2}m \\pi^2   = \\omega_B \\left( a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2}  \\right)\\]\nWe find that the energy eigenlevels are\n\\[\\ket{n}=\\omega_B\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\n*** Calculating the degeneracy\n\nWe started by saying that the plateaux in the IQHE correspond to the various filled Landau levels of the simple particle in a magnetic field system. We still need to prove this, namely by deriving the conductivity for the Hall states. This can get rather messy, so I will show put the derivation for a single particle here, and the more general derivation of the so called /Kubo formula/ in the Appendix.\n\n=sloppy=\n\nTo find the resistivity, we use Ohm's law, which relates the energy of a particle to the current density (current over area)\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{E}=\\sigma \\mathbf{J}\n    \\label{eq:ohm}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (4)$$\n\nOur mechanical momentum is\n\\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} = m \\hat{\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}}\\]\nClassically, the current (for a single particle) is simply $\\mathbf{I}=-e\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}$, but isnce we are working quantum mechanically we take the expectation value\n\n\\[I=-e/m \\sum_filled_states \\bra{\\psi}-i\\hbar\\nabla+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\ket{\\psi} \\]\n\nWe are working in Landau gauge.\n\n...\n\nWe end up with\n*** Edge modes\n\nIn order to provide a more thorough calculation (i.e. not just considering a single electron) we take advantage of a the fact that the system is bounded. I will not reproduce this here.\n\n\n*** Robutsness\n\nThe explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\nThis is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness.\n\nExperimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Figure 1: <<fig:disorder>>Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:disorder\n[[file:./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n#+caption: Figure 2: <<fig:extended>>Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:extended\n[[file:./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (5)$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    | \\Delta V | <<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} |\n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (6)$$\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.=\n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=.\n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see [@Tong2016]\n\n\nThat is it for the IQHE, as we derived the two things we needed from it: we gained a general understanding of why the plateaux have their values (they are the energy eigenvalues of the Landau levels) and, more importantly, we roughly understand why these plateaux are robust.\nUnfortunately, this is not the end of the story, we did not even mention anything topological yet! For that we finally turn to the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.\n\n[fn:5] Improved performance of impure 2D materials is an active area of research in material science, see [@Wang2020] for a summary of how impurities enhance the conductivity of graphene.\n\n[fn:6] The non-dirty sample just discussed is a great example of taking an idealization too seriously: we cannot explain the phenomena in the idealized setting, and have to retrofit extra physics on top of the idealization in order to get a satisfying explanation, only for us to then show in the limit of no impurities we regain our initial idealization. If this limit would not have been smooth (it fortunately is), we would have wasted all this time!\n\n\n** The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nFollowing the naming convention of the IQHE, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) refers to the observation of plateaux at /fractional/ values of the quantum of resistance in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$. Sadly, very few of the arguments mentioned above will be able to explain these plateaux, as we have only shown that they appear at fully filled Landau levels. However, our intuition about the robustness will still hold.\n\n\nThe goal of this expos\\'e is twofold. First we want to gain a general understanding of how the FQHE is thought about in general: what assumptions go into calculating the relevant parameters, which idealizations are noteworthy, etc. The other main goal is the 'derivation' of the Laughlin wavefunction, the wavefunction used to describe the FQH system, and its excitations. At the end we will arrive at the problem of calculating the exchange statistics of these excitations, which turn out to be /anyons/, but not actually compute them yet: this will be done in section ref:sec:GeometricPhase.\n\n\nThe key difference between the description of the Fractional as opposed to the Integer Quantum Hall effect is the inclusion of electron interactions in the former, which becomes impossible to ignore at the energy scales above $\\nu=1$, which is where most of the FQHE physics is done. As a result the reasoning cannot be as rigorous as before. In the IQHE we could pretend that all the states occupied the same Landau level, which allowed us to calculate the wavefunctions and energy levels, leading to the derivation of the Hall resistivity and confirm our suspicion that the plateaux correspond to fully filled Landau levels. Only after doing that did we let go of that idealization and allow the degeneracy to be lifted in order to argue that the plateaux were robust.\n\nThis order of operation is no longer possible in the FQHE, as the electron interactions lift the degeneracy of the Landau levels from the start, forcing us to compute the wavefunctions in a different way. A first approach would be to use perturbation theory: model the electron interaction as a small perturbation to ref:eq:landauham and then gradually compute a better and better approximation to the actual wavefunction. While this is fine for simple two-electron systems, the number of electrons in a QH system is closer to $10^{23}$. That is a rather large matrix to diagonalize, not even close to possible to do numerically. Therefore, we need to pull some tricks.\n\nThe trick is: do not compute the wave function, just write one down. That is exactly what [@Laughlin1983] did, yielding what we now call the *Laughlin wavefunction*\n\n[[file:20210311182300-the_laughlin_wavefunction.org][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]\n\nLaughlin of course did not just simply write down a bunch of wavefunction and pick the one he liked best, it is motivated by some observations from the system and from some general conditions we have to place on any wavefunction. Specifically, in a previous paper [@Laughlin1983a] he derived the wavefunctions for three particles in the FQHE. Recapping this in the case of two electrons is worthwhile.\n\nWe have a system of two electrons with a potential $V(|r_1-r_2|)$.\n- To solve such systems, it's easiest to work with angular momentum.\n- If we want to work with angular momentum, the gauge we picked before (Landau Gauge) is not very useful, as it does not include any kind of rotation\n  - Instead we pick /symmetric gauge/, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\times \\mathbf{B}= -yB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + xB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n- Skipping multiple steps ahead, we see that the wavefunctions look like\n\nUnfortunately this does not uniquely or straightforwardly generalize to N particles, so we have to pull a few more tricks.\n1. We do try to generalize, and say that a wavefunction for N particles will look something like $f(z)e^{something}$\n2. We /insist/ that the wavefunction be in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) it can possibly be: there are no other Landau levels it can fall back on. This is rather strong. This leads to the claim that $f(z)$ /must/ be analytic. =how=\n3. Since the state will have to describe fermions, the wave function must be anti-symmetric under exchange of the particles, which requires $f(z)$ to be odd.\n4. Finally, since we need to conserve angular momentum, we require that =f(z) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree M, where M is the total angular momentum.=\n\nAll these constraints add up to the fact that $f(z)=\\prod_{j<k}(z_j-z_k)^m$, with $m$ odd.\n*This is what people mean when they say that the LWF falls into the same universality class as the actual wavefunction, as any wavefunction needs to account for this.[fn:3]*\n\nWell, neat, you might say, but this still just describes fermions, I thought we were going to be talking about anyons! Right you are, things only really get exciting once we start talking about /excitations/ of this ground state.\n\n- The excitations of the FQH state (technically of the state described by the Laughlin wavefunction, which are not exactly alike)\n\n[fn:3] The LWF might appear to just be an easy to compute with exemplar of this universality class, but it actually has some other nice features which set it apart from its siblings, see =other nice feature of LWF=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Phase\n\n* Unresolved Issues\n\n** What is the importance of the 2D idealization for the FQHE\nThe quantum hall effect has also been studied in three dimensions, see [@Torres2020; @Tang2019; @Pavlosiuk2017].\n\nApparently it is not as straightforward as I thought, people have constructed the 3D fractional quantum hall effect, but it's rather difficult.\n\nThe difference-maker for whether an electron gas is 2D seems to be it's Fermi-surface topology.\n[[file:20210601145016-3d_quantum_hall_effect.org][3D Quantum Hall Effect]]\n* Citations I still need to use\n\n[@Shech2015b]\n\n[@Wilczek1982]\n\n[@Rao2001]\n\n[@Knapp2016]\n\n\\printbibliography\n"}],"additions":13,"deletions":1}],"additions":13,"deletions":1},{"oid":"f244e6fb61c1e21120995af42cb4796925e232e6","message":"Scripted auto-commit on change (2021-06-08 16:58:25) by gitwatch.sh\n","date":1623164306,"files":[{"filepath":"20210528160149-outline_anyons.tmp6aVMYQ.org","oid":"77695ed6d4de25cb0927dce2c5d0e221e00c55a4","diff":[{"count":1378,"value":"# Created 2021-06-07 Mon 22:59\n#+TITLE: Outline Anyons\n#+AUTHOR: Thomas F.

However, many things are postulated in physics and never realized, so just being an idealization does not make it intersitng.\n   However, anyons are claimed to be observed [@Bartolomei2020]. How then do we square this?\n\n\nSome, like [@Shech2019], go even further and claim that these kinds of observations give indirect evidence for Platonism, making anyons even more intersting to look at.\n\nThe standard explanation of anyons is inherently /topological/. Topological explanation share something inherently in common with idealizations, and are thus extra worth looking at.\n\nWe can't directly talk about the failure of any particular idealization, only about a certain property. Anyons are interesting because the property is existence.\n\n\nHowever, to properly understand anyons, we need to look at the actual systems from which they come, which are things that look like the quantum hall effect. Otherwise we are simply examining the idealization on its own, rather than seeing whether the idealization corresponds to reality in any way (super-symmetry etc). Therefore, we should look at the FQHE to properly evaluate the status of anyons.\n\nFrom examining this, we see that the phase does not arise topologically in the description of the quantum hall effect (as you cannot really calculate things with that) but /geometrically/. Thus we will need to examine how geometric phase works and whether and how this could be related to the topology.\n\nThis discussion will then offer some inspiration for how such topological questions should be thought of.\n- Topological explanations are not uncommon in physics, example?.\n\n** New intro\n\n=Good line to introduce the chapter=\n\n\nThe main subject of discussion here will be a new class of (quasi-)particles: anyons. In undergraduate courses, or, if you're lucky, highschool, we learn that two types of particles exist: fermions and bosons. These particles are distinguished by spin, half-integer and integer spin respectively. Anyons, as their name suggests, break this binary and are allowed /any/ type of spin, creating a whole new category of particle.[fn:4] While anyons are fascinating in their own right, we are interested in them because, according to the canon explanation, anyons are two-dimensional particles. More suggestively, the space they occupy cannot be /approximately/ $2D$, such as a $3D$ space of $1nm$ height, but /exactly/ two dimensional: a clear case of an infinite(simal) idealization. Of course, anyons would be just another plaything, were it not that, at the time of writing, anyons have rather strong empirical backing [@Bartolomei2020].\n\n\nAnother reason why anyons present such an interesting case, is that their explanation explicitly requires /topological/ arguments. Topological arguments, as I will show, show up in unexpected places and allow problematic idealizations to sneak in, as they smooth out many of the difficult to solve geometry. By tackling such an explicit use of topology in an infinite idealization, we will be able to use the argumentative structure in our general analysis of infinite idealizations. =The opposite of topology is geometry=\n"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"***************"},{"count":5,"value":"\n*************** TODO "},{"count":2,"removed":true,"value":"Introduce "},{"count":2,"value":"this "},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"distinction"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"is"},{"count":1,"value":" "},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"between"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"a"},{"count":1,"value":" "},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"topology"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"new"},{"count":1,"value":" "},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"and"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"task"},{"count":1,"value":" "},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"geometry"},{"count":3,"added":true,"value":"tallyho\n***************"},{"count":1,"value":" "},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"more clearly"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"END"},{"count":2,"value":"\n\n"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"\n"},{"count":37,"value":"[fn:4] Or an infinite number of new particle types, depending on one's preference.\n\n\n\n"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"\n"},{"count":14326,"value":"* Topology and Anyons\n\nIn a standard physics undergraduate program, you learn that there are two types of particles, fermions and bosons, which are distinguished by their spin, fermions coming in half-integer multiples $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} , ... )$ and bosons in integer multiples $(0, 1, 2, ...)$. A good starting question for understanding anyons would be: why /do/ we think there are only two types of particles? Why not $1$, or $3$, or infintely many? While many similar questions are as of yet unanswerable, such as why there appear to be only three generations of leptons (e.g. electrons, muons, tauons) or three fundamental forces in the standard model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), this one does have an accepted answer. It is, as always, a combination of experimental results and theory. Fermions and bosons' share few features besides the fact that they are particles, but the important commonality is that they are both /indistinguishable/ particles. Every electron is the exact same as every other electron, and every photon is perfectly identical to the next. There is no way to tell whether two fermions or two bosons have switched places when you weren't looking. We will explore the consequences of this in more detail later, but the important consequence of this fact is that it induces an overdescription of the physical situation: we can mathematically describe two situations, one in which we have electron $1$ on the left and electron $2$ on the left. While mathematically distinct, these situations are physically identical, and in order for our physics to make sense we need to account for this distinction. The reasons for assuming indistinguishability could be a thesis topic in its own right, and the above description does not attempt to do it justice. The important point is /how/ we arrive from this indistinguishability to the fact that there are two types of particles: how does indistinguishability help us distinguish particles, and how do we mathematically distinguish these identical states?\n\nAs a warm-up, let us consider a rather handwavey argument. Handwavey, because it relies on the particles still being distinguishable, but it illustrates the point. Say we start with a system $\\Psi_0$ of two particles, $x_1$ and $x_2$, each with their own probability distribution $\\psi_i$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)\\]\nNow, for our next trick, we will exchange the two particles, such that particle $x_1$ is in state $\\psi_a$ and particle $x_2$ is in state $\\psi_b$. If we suggestively take state $\\psi_i$ to be mean something like \"having probability $1$ of being found around $x=a$\", then this exchange can be the physical exchange of the two particles. Now, of course, we do not know which particle is which, so writing down the 1-exchange wave function would be getting ahead of ourselves, but we do know that if we were to exchange the particles once again we should regain our initial wavefunction $\\Psi_0$. To dentote this, we define an exchange operator $P$ which does just, and say that the wavefunction after exchanging twice (= rotating by 360 degrees) is $\\psi_{2\\pi}=P^2\\psi_0=1\\psi_0$. To find the wavefunction of the 1-exchang system, we find\n\\[\\psi_{\\pi}=P\\psi_0=\\sqrt{1}\\psi_0=\\pm 1\\psi_0\\]\n\nThis yields two possibilities for particles: those for with $P=-1$ and those for which $P=1$. The latter are bosons and the former are fermions.[fn:7]\n\n\n\n\nThe above argument is too handwavey, so we would like to make it more concrete. The way to define what we mean by \"exchange/ability/\". To start, the suggestively italicized /ability/ part of exchangeability hints at the fact that the /possible/ ways a particle /is able to be/ exchanged is of central importance. One natural way of defining this is by looking at all the possible paths the particle can take. We would need to look at the /configuration space/ of the particles: the possible configurations of them and connections between these configurations.[fn:8] Now we need to supplant this with a notion of what it means for two paths to be /the same/, or, equivalently, what it means for two paths to be different. This idea of path-similarity depends on which factors we judge relevant when considering manipulating quantum particles, which we need to choose if we wish to obtain the most general description possible. Like most of physics, we would not want our description to depend on some sort of absolute position or orientation in space, so our description better ignore those. Beyond that, however, identifying the relevant factors of the space becomes more tricky. The two most promising candidates are a /geometric/ or /topological/ notion of path similarity. As it turns out, the latter is used in the most commonly accepted explanation of anyons, the main reason being the mathematical and conceptual simplicity it brings.\n\nThe main notion of similarity used to explain anyons, namely the topological notion of /homotopy equivalence/, roughly means that two paths are the same if they can be continuously deformed into one another. This differs wildly from /geometric/ path equivalence: there paths are only \"the same\" if they traverse the same path in the same space, they need to be =isomorphic=. Consider the difference between a mountain ridge versus a nice meadow. Geometrically, the two are very different, and if we were to care about how exhausting a hike over that distance would be we would certainly not neglect to take those differences into consideration. On the other hand, if we were an amateur nautical cartographer interested in plotting out all bodies of water in the area, we would consider both spaces identically topologically: neither of them has any lakes. It is clear why a topological approach to particle paths would be attractive, as it massively simplifies the set of possibilities down to the bare essentials. It is clear that sometimes we do need to consider the relevant geometry however: our hiker will no doubt complain if their map-making friend confuses meadows for mountains, or vice versa depending on their constitution.\n\nReturning to anyons, we see that the approach taken for the /explanation/ turns out to be topological, while when actually calculating the phase we need to take into account the /geometry/. Here we will first discuss the topological argument, after which we will consider the prequisites for and the geometrical argument itself in Section 3 and 4.\n\nBy focussing on the homotopy notion of equivalent paths, we release ourselves from the burden of having to examine each individual path and instead are able to focus on features of the /space/. Specifically, since we only need whether two paths are continuously deformed into one another, we just need to look at whether the space allows for such trickyness. This feature of a space is called its *connectedness*. A space is called *simply connected* iff all /loops/ can be deformed into a point, like in figure ref:fig:connectedness. For our purposes, since we are looking at the position of a particle in spacetime, we can consider a space to be simply connected if it has no holes. Here a hole is a hole that \"pierces\" the space: the handle in the \"space\" of a coffeecup and the hole in the \"space\" of a donut are prime examples, while the inside of a bottle or a bubble in a glass of coke do not count as \"holes\" for the sake of connectedness. On the contrary, spaces with such holes are called /multiply-connected/, or sometimes more simply /non-simply-connected/ spaces.\n\nThis concept of connectedness allows us to understand the main assumption behind the handwavey argument above: we return to the same position after rotating 2\\pi if the space is simply connected, because \"being the same\" means \"being the same path\" and \"being the same path\" means \"being able to continuously deform them to each other\" and \"doing nothing\" is the \"point path\" and you are only able to shrink all paths to a point in a simply connected space. This, of course, raises the question: is the configuration space of two identical particles always simply connected, i.e., why do should we return to the same system after rotating $2\\pi$? As we will see, it is simply connected in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but /not/ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is why people say that anyons can only exist in 2D. As we will also see, however, is that this is not strictly true, as we can conceive of somewhat plausible multiply-connected 3D spaces.\n\n[fn:7] Note that this does not directly follow: it could also be the case that particles just sometimes have -1 and other times +1. Empirically, however, we find no such distinction, only dependent on particle type.\n\n[fn:8] The other framework for considering such exchange is in terms of exchanging all the relevant quantum numbers, effectively mathematically swapping the particles. We shall see that this does not work for defining anyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Phase\n\nMuch of the upcoming section will be centered around calculating the /phase/ of a quantum system, and it will be useful to briefly go over what we mean by phase and its relation to anyons. Briefly stated, the phase factor is a complex number which does not change the physical information if applied globally, that is when multiplying every wavefunction under consideration with it. The $\\pm1$ applied by our operator $P$ is such a phase.\nPhase arises because the empirical outcome of measuring a quantum state involves calculating the modulo-squared of the wavefunction. There are simply (at least) two wavefunctions which arrive at the same outcome if you square them with their complex conjugate: - that wavefunction and plus that wavefunction. They are both perfectly fine mathematical representations of the same state, just like the fact that the square root of 9 can be both -3 and 3. When asked: what is the length of the side of a square field of 9 square meters, the answer is indeterminate: it can be either 3 or -3. Rather than saying it can only be positive, we can be a bit more general and say that the \"phase factor\" in front of the three is unphysical: it simply does not matter for calculating the surface area of the field what  it is. We have, of course, some empirical preference for using positive lengths in stead of negative ones, but we do not such physical intuitions for wave functions, as they live in Hilbert Space and we unfortunately only have 4D spacetime to our disposal. Since wavefunctions live in /complex/ Hilbert space, the most general factor that would get $||^2$ away is not $\\pm 1$, but $e^{i\\theta}$, as that simply /is/ the square root of $1$ in $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus any wavefunction will show empirical differences when multiplied with $e^{i\\theta}\\quad\\forall\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\nIt is of course not immediately clear what this has to do with paths in configuration space or anyons for that fact. The answer is that, while systems could theoretically obtain any phase, they do not in general do so. We know from examining the time-dependent Schrodinger equation that it can be reduced to the time-/independent/ schrodinger equation times a phase factor, which depends on time and the energy of the system. However, while we said that phase does not matter physically, this is only the case for the system as a whole: if two systems have different phase they interfere. It's analogous measuring any other kind of wave: you will have to pick a starting point in order to describe the offset of a particular wave. These phases don't matter until you measure two waves interfering, which leads to inteference. For particles this leads to destructive interference for fermions: if the exact same wave would =xxxxxxxxxx= then there is probability zero of it being there. This is the Pauli-exclusion principle.\n\nThus while phases do not appear to matter /prima faciae/, they are the reason matter is able to exist in the first place! Without the Pauli Exclusion Principle it would not be possible for matter to clump together, as everything would simply phase through each other (barring electromagnetic interactions).\n\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]] :level 2\n\n\n** The configuration space explanation for anyons\n\nThe topological explanation gestured at above consists of roughly the following steps:\n1. Construct the /configuration space/ of the system, that is, all possible positions our particle pair could be in.\n2. Find all possible homotopy equivalent paths, and, by extension, the /fundamental group/ of the space.\n3. Derive the 1D-representation of that group, that is, a scalar representing that group. This is the phase-factor.\n\nWe will go through these steps in detail for the case of anyons and other particles. After showing that anyons appear to only be possible in 2D, we construct a toy 3D-configuration space in which anyons are also possible.\n\n\n*** The 3D case\n**** Constructing the configuration space\nOur first task is to construct the configuration space for the exchange of $N$ identical particles in $3D$, after which we will examine its topological properties. The most general configuration space we can construct is one for $N$ particles living in $d$ dimensions, which would be\n \n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbb{R}^d_1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_2 ... \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_N\n    \\label{eq:Ndconfig}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (1)$$\n\nWe shall for now focus on just two particles in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which would be the configuration space occupied by two $3$-dimensional vectors $(r_1, r_2)$ representing two particles\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3  \\]\nAs we are dealing with identical particles, however, we need to add some extra structure, which results in our configuration space being much smaller than the above.\n\nTo simplify our notation and avoid having to conceptualize $9$-dimensional space, we can define our configuration space in terms of the center of mass of the particles $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1+r_2})}{2}$ and their difference vector $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r_1-r_2}$. Clearly the configuration space of $(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r})$ is still $\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. However, now we can pull a trick. We only care about exchanging the particles, right? It seems reasonable, therefore, that the position of the system as a whole does not play in a role in determining all possible positions of the particle, e.g. it should not matter (we assume, quite reasonably) whether we exchange two fermions in our lab on Earth or on Venus. For our purposes, then, we can safely ignore one of the two $\\mathbb{R}^3$s and simply focus on the relative distance and orientation of the two particles with each other.[fn:9] This simplifies the problem of finding the configuration space significantly.\n\nLet us return to the constraints. The first constraint is the indistinguishability of the particles. Since it is impossible to distinguish the situation $(r_1,r_2)$ from $(r_2,r_1)$, we cannot take these two configurations to be separate points in configuration space and must remove them. We can represent this by \"dividing out\" the permutation group $S_2$ from our current configuration space,[fn:10] yielding\n\\[\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^3 }{S_2}\\]\n\nThe second and final constraint is accounting for particles not being able to intersect with each other. The argument for /why/ we ought to, however, is rarely made precise. The general tendency, as by\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n[fn:9] Another way of thinking about this is to consider one particle to be fixed and the other moving around it.\n\n[fn:10] This makes it somewhat difficult to visually relate the \"one particle standing still\" picture to what the configuration space actually represents. Roughly, you can imagine it as the \"moving\" particle returning back to its original position after a rotation of $\\pi$ radians.\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect\n\nSo, anyons are claimed to be observed in 2D only.\nHowever, some claim that anyons are observed [@Bartolomei2020]  in actual systems. Does this mean that those systems are /actually/ two dimensional? This would go against much of our general intuition about systems.\n- Physisists claim that these systems are /approximatley/ or /effectively/ 2D (=sources=).\n- Following [@Norton2012], we know how to interpret this: we can demote an idealization to an approximation if we are able to show that there is a smooth limit.\n- This is exactly the problem, according to [@Shech2019]: the topological explanation of anyons requires an /exact/ 2D system (or a rather ad-hoc 2D system as we saw).\n- Therefore we cannot call this approximately 2D.\n- According to [@Shech2019], this is a problem for those with nominalist inclinations[fn:1], as the instantiation of abstract mathematical structures in the real world would be an issue.\n  - Such an argument can only be made, however, through the use of the EIA which was discussed in the previous (or next?) chapter.\n- Therefore, it would do such people well to examine the physical effect thoroughly for any signs of this.\n\n\n\nLuckily, hope is on the horizon: it turns out that the computations of the phase of the alledged anyons in the FQHE uses a geometrical notion rather than a topological notion of phase.\n- Unluckily, this geometrical notion also relies on a two dimensional idealization.\n- However, this idealization /could/ conceivably be demoted to an approximation.\n\nIn this chapter, we will examine the inner working of the Quantum Hall Effect. This is needed in order to understand the following\n1. Why do people say that these particles are anyons\n2. What idealizations are made in the explanation of the quantum hall effect separate from the topological one.\n3. ...\n\nReaders less interested in the details can skip to the last subsection of this section =link= and the next section =link=.\n\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect is the quantum version of the classical hall effect, a rather straightforward consequence of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. It was discovered all the way back in =XXXX= by Edwin Hall, who claimed it a novelty which would never have any use-case. Today Hall-Effect sensors are widely used to pick up magnetic fields and rotations of conducting materials. More esoteric applications are as potential long-term space-travel propellants in so-called Hall-Effect thrusters, which are a specific form of ion propolsion, which can generate a low thrust for a very long amount of time.\n\nThe basics of the effect are rather simple\n- Strip which has current flowing through it.\n- Magnetic field perpendicular to that strip\n- Induces Lorentz force which pushes particles to one side, increasing their concentration and creating a potential difference, inducing a voltage changing the resistivity.\n- This resistivity linearly depends on the voltage, which linearly depends on the concentration difference which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field, thus yielding a linear dependence of the resistivity to the strenght of the perpendicular magnetic field.\n- Looks like figure ref:fig:che\n\nHowever, as most classical effects, they only hold in a certain regime. When we clean up the materials, lower the temperature dramatically (<2K) and increase the magnetic field strength considerably, we observe the /Quantum Hall Effect/ (QHE): rather than a linear dependence on the magnetic field strength, the resistivity shows these strange plateaux at rather consistent values, as in ref:fig:qhe. The spacing between these plateaux does not seem to differ between different materials, which is even more curious.\n\nSo: why? Why do we see these plateaux, and why at these levels? The short answer (partially) is: the impurities in the sample lift the degeneracy of the eigenstates of the Quantum Hall system, called Landau levels, and /localizes/ some of those states, rather than the states extending from one edge of the sample to the other (akin to the wavefunctions of a particle in a box). These localized states do not conduct current (as do not span the system, and resistivity is measured from end to end), thus leading to the plateaux in the resistivity: we change plateaux when all the localized states are filled and we move to different extended states. The specific values of these levels depend on weird physics at the boundaries of the system called /edge-modes/, but in short the levels correspond to the number of filled Landau levels: at higher magnetic field strengths the levels can accommodate more states, thus the lower the magnetic field strength the larger the number of available levels, leading to a smooth-looking linear dependence in the classical regime.\n\nThere are quite some caveats to the above story, but that is the gist of why the effect happens for /integer levels/. The less interested reader can skip over the following section describing the corresponding /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/ (IQHE) and head to the description of its fractional cousin, where the same does not hold. Specifically, the IQHE requires one massive idealization: electron interaction is neglected completely. As we shall see, this idealization cannot hold in the FQHE.\n\n[fn:1] If the reader was not aware of this yet, the author does hold such inclinations.\n\n** The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\nIn order to do as little physics as is possibly required, I will skip most of the justification for the quantum formalism of the QHE (quantizing the classical Hamiltonian, finding the commutators) and many of the intermediate steps to arrive at the relevant results. I point the interested reader to [@Tong2016][[]] for a quite accessible and to [@Arovas2020] for a more thorough pedagogical discussion of these issues, and to [@Stone1992; @Prange1987; @Doucot2005] for rather complete, less pedagogical sources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) is the observation of plateaux in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ at regular intervals. These intervals happen to be integer multiples of the /quantum of resistance/  $R_q=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2}$. =check whether this is so=\n- This is rather curious, why so precise?\n- In fact, so precise that these experiments are used to determine the quantum of resistance.\n- Why are they there, and why at those levels?\n\nAs physicists, the first thought as to the origin of these plateaux probably goes to the energy eigenstates of the system, which turns out to be correct! The plateaux correspond to the general energy eigenstates of a system of charged particles moving in a perpendicular magnetic field, so called Landau levels.\n- It will be difficult to properly understand the QHE without first briefly going over landau levels.\n\n=Assumptions=\n\n*** Landau Levels\n\nHere we already start to sneak in our idealizations: we will treat this system as if it is two dimensional. =However, this system can be easily extended to 3D, see XXXX=\n\nThe simplest Hamiltonian for a system of particles moving in a magnetic field is\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2} m(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} +e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} )^2\n    \\label{eq:landauham}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (2)$$\n\nThe  magnetic field is perpendicular to the $x,y$-plane, so we define the vector potential $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}$ using our knowledge that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane $\\nabla\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=B \\hat{z}$, to be\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\nxB\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n    \\label{eq:landaugauge}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (3)$$\n\n=This will be appendix=\nThe easiest way to find the energy eigenstates is the way all Hamiltonians get solved: treat is as the harmonic oscillator. As the Hamiltonian of the \"normal\" harmonic oscillator is\n\n\n..\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x - i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for $\\pi$ then tell us that $a$ and $a^\\dagger$ obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n\\[H= \\frac{1}{2}m \\pi^2   = \\omega_B \\left( a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2}  \\right)\\]\nWe find that the energy eigenlevels are\n\\[\\ket{n}=\\omega_B\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\n*** Calculating the degeneracy\n\nWe started by saying that the plateaux in the IQHE correspond to the various filled Landau levels of the simple particle in a magnetic field system. We still need to prove this, namely by deriving the conductivity for the Hall states. This can get rather messy, so I will show put the derivation for a single particle here, and the more general derivation of the so called /Kubo formula/ in the Appendix.\n\n=sloppy=\n\nTo find the resistivity, we use Ohm's law, which relates the energy of a particle to the current density (current over area)\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{E}=\\sigma \\mathbf{J}\n    \\label{eq:ohm}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (4)$$\n\nOur mechanical momentum is\n\\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} = m \\hat{\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}}\\]\nClassically, the current (for a single particle) is simply $\\mathbf{I}=-e\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}$, but isnce we are working quantum mechanically we take the expectation value\n\n\\[I=-e/m \\sum_filled_states \\bra{\\psi}-i\\hbar\\nabla+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\ket{\\psi} \\]\n\nWe are working in Landau gauge.\n\n...\n\nWe end up with\n*** Edge modes\n\nIn order to provide a more thorough calculation (i.e. not just considering a single electron) we take advantage of a the fact that the system is bounded. I will not reproduce this here.\n\n\n*** Robutsness\n\nThe explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\nThis is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness.\n\nExperimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Figure 1: <<fig:disorder>>Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:disorder\n[[file:./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n#+caption: Figure 2: <<fig:extended>>Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:extended\n[[file:./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (5)$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    | \\Delta V | <<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} |\n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (6)$$\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.=\n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=.\n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see [@Tong2016]\n\n\nThat is it for the IQHE, as we derived the two things we needed from it: we gained a general understanding of why the plateaux have their values (they are the energy eigenvalues of the Landau levels) and, more importantly, we roughly understand why these plateaux are robust.\nUnfortunately, this is not the end of the story, we did not even mention anything topological yet! For that we finally turn to the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.\n\n[fn:5] Improved performance of impure 2D materials is an active area of research in material science, see [@Wang2020] for a summary of how impurities enhance the conductivity of graphene.\n\n[fn:6] The non-dirty sample just discussed is a great example of taking an idealization too seriously: we cannot explain the phenomena in the idealized setting, and have to retrofit extra physics on top of the idealization in order to get a satisfying explanation, only for us to then show in the limit of no impurities we regain our initial idealization. If this limit would not have been smooth (it fortunately is), we would have wasted all this time!\n\n\n** The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nFollowing the naming convention of the IQHE, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) refers to the observation of plateaux at /fractional/ values of the quantum of resistance in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$. Sadly, very few of the arguments mentioned above will be able to explain these plateaux, as we have only shown that they appear at fully filled Landau levels. However, our intuition about the robustness will still hold.\n\n\nThe goal of this expos\\'e is twofold. First we want to gain a general understanding of how the FQHE is thought about in general: what assumptions go into calculating the relevant parameters, which idealizations are noteworthy, etc. The other main goal is the 'derivation' of the Laughlin wavefunction, the wavefunction used to describe the FQH system, and its excitations. At the end we will arrive at the problem of calculating the exchange statistics of these excitations, which turn out to be /anyons/, but not actually compute them yet: this will be done in section ref:sec:GeometricPhase.\n\n\nThe key difference between the description of the Fractional as opposed to the Integer Quantum Hall effect is the inclusion of electron interactions in the former, which becomes impossible to ignore at the energy scales above $\\nu=1$, which is where most of the FQHE physics is done. As a result the reasoning cannot be as rigorous as before. In the IQHE we could pretend that all the states occupied the same Landau level, which allowed us to calculate the wavefunctions and energy levels, leading to the derivation of the Hall resistivity and confirm our suspicion that the plateaux correspond to fully filled Landau levels. Only after doing that did we let go of that idealization and allow the degeneracy to be lifted in order to argue that the plateaux were robust.\n\nThis order of operation is no longer possible in the FQHE, as the electron interactions lift the degeneracy of the Landau levels from the start, forcing us to compute the wavefunctions in a different way. A first approach would be to use perturbation theory: model the electron interaction as a small perturbation to ref:eq:landauham and then gradually compute a better and better approximation to the actual wavefunction. While this is fine for simple two-electron systems, the number of electrons in a QH system is closer to $10^{23}$. That is a rather large matrix to diagonalize, not even close to possible to do numerically. Therefore, we need to pull some tricks.\n\nThe trick is: do not compute the wave function, just write one down. That is exactly what [@Laughlin1983] did, yielding what we now call the *Laughlin wavefunction*\n\n[[file:20210311182300-the_laughlin_wavefunction.org][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]\n\nLaughlin of course did not just simply write down a bunch of wavefunction and pick the one he liked best, it is motivated by some observations from the system and from some general conditions we have to place on any wavefunction. Specifically, in a previous paper [@Laughlin1983a] he derived the wavefunctions for three particles in the FQHE. Recapping this in the case of two electrons is worthwhile.\n\nWe have a system of two electrons with a potential $V(|r_1-r_2|)$.\n- To solve such systems, it's easiest to work with angular momentum.\n- If we want to work with angular momentum, the gauge we picked before (Landau Gauge) is not very useful, as it does not include any kind of rotation\n  - Instead we pick /symmetric gauge/, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\times \\mathbf{B}= -yB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + xB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n- Skipping multiple steps ahead, we see that the wavefunctions look like\n\nUnfortunately this does not uniquely or straightforwardly generalize to N particles, so we have to pull a few more tricks.\n1. We do try to generalize, and say that a wavefunction for N particles will look something like $f(z)e^{something}$\n2. We /insist/ that the wavefunction be in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) it can possibly be: there are no other Landau levels it can fall back on. This is rather strong. This leads to the claim that $f(z)$ /must/ be analytic. =how=\n3. Since the state will have to describe fermions, the wave function must be anti-symmetric under exchange of the particles, which requires $f(z)$ to be odd.\n4. Finally, since we need to conserve angular momentum, we require that =f(z) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree M, where M is the total angular momentum.=\n\nAll these constraints add up to the fact that $f(z)=\\prod_{j<k}(z_j-z_k)^m$, with $m$ odd.\n*This is what people mean when they say that the LWF falls into the same universality class as the actual wavefunction, as any wavefunction needs to account for this.[fn:3]*\n\nWell, neat, you might say, but this still just describes fermions, I thought we were going to be talking about anyons! Right you are, things only really get exciting once we start talking about /excitations/ of this ground state.\n\n- The excitations of the FQH state (technically of the state described by the Laughlin wavefunction, which are not exactly alike)\n\n[fn:3] The LWF might appear to just be an easy to compute with exemplar of this universality class, but it actually has some other nice features which set it apart from its siblings, see =other nice feature of LWF=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Phase\n\n* Unresolved Issues\n\n** What is the importance of the 2D idealization for the FQHE\nThe quantum hall effect has also been studied in three dimensions, see [@Torres2020; @Tang2019; @Pavlosiuk2017].\n\nApparently it is not as straightforward as I thought, people have constructed the 3D fractional quantum hall effect, but it's rather difficult.\n\nThe difference-maker for whether an electron gas is 2D seems to be it's Fermi-surface topology.\n[[file:20210601145016-3d_quantum_hall_effect.org][3D Quantum Hall Effect]]\n* Citations I still need to use\n\n[@Shech2015b]\n\n[@Wilczek1982]\n\n[@Rao2001]\n\n[@Knapp2016]\n\n\\printbibliography\n"}],"additions":7,"deletions":11}],"additions":7,"deletions":11},{"oid":"8b4088c373b50da2a7094fc6fa1faad07fbb2954","message":"Scripted auto-commit on change (2021-06-08 18:44:20) by gitwatch.sh\n","date":1623170660,"files":[{"filepath":"20210528160149-outline_anyons.tmp6aVMYQ.org","oid":"10f8407db6e53454a97ebff47f0c28d8c8b1f932","diff":[{"count":23,"value":"# Created 2021-06-07 Mon 22:59\n#+TITLE: Outline Anyons"},{"count":2,"added":true,"value":" bad"},{"count":15741,"value":"\n#+AUTHOR: Thomas F.

However, many things are postulated in physics and never realized, so just being an idealization does not make it intersitng.\n   However, anyons are claimed to be observed [@Bartolomei2020]. How then do we square this?\n\n\nSome, like [@Shech2019], go even further and claim that these kinds of observations give indirect evidence for Platonism, making anyons even more intersting to look at.\n\nThe standard explanation of anyons is inherently /topological/. Topological explanation share something inherently in common with idealizations, and are thus extra worth looking at.\n\nWe can't directly talk about the failure of any particular idealization, only about a certain property. Anyons are interesting because the property is existence.\n\n\nHowever, to properly understand anyons, we need to look at the actual systems from which they come, which are things that look like the quantum hall effect. Otherwise we are simply examining the idealization on its own, rather than seeing whether the idealization corresponds to reality in any way (super-symmetry etc). Therefore, we should look at the FQHE to properly evaluate the status of anyons.\n\nFrom examining this, we see that the phase does not arise topologically in the description of the quantum hall effect (as you cannot really calculate things with that) but /geometrically/. Thus we will need to examine how geometric phase works and whether and how this could be related to the topology.\n\nThis discussion will then offer some inspiration for how such topological questions should be thought of.\n- Topological explanations are not uncommon in physics, example?.\n\n** New intro\n\n=Good line to introduce the chapter=\n\n\nThe main subject of discussion here will be a new class of (quasi-)particles: anyons. In undergraduate courses, or, if you're lucky, highschool, we learn that two types of particles exist: fermions and bosons. These particles are distinguished by spin, half-integer and integer spin respectively. Anyons, as their name suggests, break this binary and are allowed /any/ type of spin, creating a whole new category of particle.[fn:4] While anyons are fascinating in their own right, we are interested in them because, according to the canon explanation, anyons are two-dimensional particles. More suggestively, the space they occupy cannot be /approximately/ $2D$, such as a $3D$ space of $1nm$ height, but /exactly/ two dimensional: a clear case of an infinite(simal) idealization. Of course, anyons would be just another plaything, were it not that, at the time of writing, anyons have rather strong empirical backing [@Bartolomei2020].\n\n\nAnother reason why anyons present such an interesting case, is that their explanation explicitly requires /topological/ arguments. Topological arguments, as I will show, show up in unexpected places and allow problematic idealizations to sneak in, as they smooth out many of the difficult to solve geometry. By tackling such an explicit use of topology in an infinite idealization, we will be able to use the argumentative structure in our general analysis of infinite idealizations. =The opposite of topology is geometry=\n\n*************** TODO this is a new task tallyho\n*************** END\n\n\n[fn:4] Or an infinite number of new particle types, depending on one's preference.\n\n\n\n* Topology and Anyons\n\nIn a standard physics undergraduate program, you learn that there are two types of particles, fermions and bosons, which are distinguished by their spin, fermions coming in half-integer multiples $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} , ... )$ and bosons in integer multiples $(0, 1, 2, ...)$. A good starting question for understanding anyons would be: why /do/ we think there are only two types of particles? Why not $1$, or $3$, or infintely many? While many similar questions are as of yet unanswerable, such as why there appear to be only three generations of leptons (e.g. electrons, muons, tauons) or three fundamental forces in the standard model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), this one does have an accepted answer. It is, as always, a combination of experimental results and theory. Fermions and bosons' share few features besides the fact that they are particles, but the important commonality is that they are both /indistinguishable/ particles. Every electron is the exact same as every other electron, and every photon is perfectly identical to the next. There is no way to tell whether two fermions or two bosons have switched places when you weren't looking. We will explore the consequences of this in more detail later, but the important consequence of this fact is that it induces an overdescription of the physical situation: we can mathematically describe two situations, one in which we have electron $1$ on the left and electron $2$ on the left. While mathematically distinct, these situations are physically identical, and in order for our physics to make sense we need to account for this distinction. The reasons for assuming indistinguishability could be a thesis topic in its own right, and the above description does not attempt to do it justice. The important point is /how/ we arrive from this indistinguishability to the fact that there are two types of particles: how does indistinguishability help us distinguish particles, and how do we mathematically distinguish these identical states?\n\nAs a warm-up, let us consider a rather handwavey argument. Handwavey, because it relies on the particles still being distinguishable, but it illustrates the point. Say we start with a system $\\Psi_0$ of two particles, $x_1$ and $x_2$, each with their own probability distribution $\\psi_i$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)\\]\nNow, for our next trick, we will exchange the two particles, such that particle $x_1$ is in state $\\psi_a$ and particle $x_2$ is in state $\\psi_b$. If we suggestively take state $\\psi_i$ to be mean something like \"having probability $1$ of being found around $x=a$\", then this exchange can be the physical exchange of the two particles. Now, of course, we do not know which particle is which, so writing down the 1-exchange wave function would be getting ahead of ourselves, but we do know that if we were to exchange the particles once again we should regain our initial wavefunction $\\Psi_0$. To dentote this, we define an exchange operator $P$ which does just, and say that the wavefunction after exchanging twice (= rotating by 360 degrees) is $\\psi_{2\\pi}=P^2\\psi_0=1\\psi_0$. To find the wavefunction of the 1-exchang system, we find\n\\[\\psi_{\\pi}=P\\psi_0=\\sqrt{1}\\psi_0=\\pm 1\\psi_0\\]\n\nThis yields two possibilities for particles: those for with $P=-1$ and those for which $P=1$. The latter are bosons and the former are fermions.[fn:7]\n\n\n\n\nThe above argument is too handwavey, so we would like to make it more concrete. The way to define what we mean by \"exchange/ability/\". To start, the suggestively italicized /ability/ part of exchangeability hints at the fact that the /possible/ ways a particle /is able to be/ exchanged is of central importance. One natural way of defining this is by looking at all the possible paths the particle can take. We would need to look at the /configuration space/ of the particles: the possible configurations of them and connections between these configurations.[fn:8] Now we need to supplant this with a notion of what it means for two paths to be /the same/, or, equivalently, what it means for two paths to be different. This idea of path-similarity depends on which factors we judge relevant when considering manipulating quantum particles, which we need to choose if we wish to obtain the most general description possible. Like most of physics, we would not want our description to depend on some sort of absolute position or orientation in space, so our description better ignore those. Beyond that, however, identifying the relevant factors of the space becomes more tricky. The two most promising candidates are a /geometric/ or /topological/ notion of path similarity. As it turns out, the latter is used in the most commonly accepted explanation of anyons, the main reason being the mathematical and conceptual simplicity it brings.\n\nThe main notion of similarity used to explain anyons, namely the topological notion of /homotopy equivalence/, roughly means that two paths are the same if they can be continuously deformed into one another. This differs wildly from /geometric/ path equivalence: there paths are only \"the same\" if they traverse the same path in the same space, they need to be =isomorphic=. Consider the difference between a mountain ridge versus a nice meadow. Geometrically, the two are very different, and if we were to care about how exhausting a hike over that distance would be we would certainly not neglect to take those differences into consideration. On the other hand, if we were an amateur nautical cartographer interested in plotting out all bodies of water in the area, we would consider both spaces identically topologically: neither of them has any lakes. It is clear why a topological approach to particle paths would be attractive, as it massively simplifies the set of possibilities down to the bare essentials. It is clear that sometimes we do need to consider the relevant geometry however: our hiker will no doubt complain if their map-making friend confuses meadows for mountains, or vice versa depending on their constitution.\n\nReturning to anyons, we see that the approach taken for the /explanation/ turns out to be topological, while when actually calculating the phase we need to take into account the /geometry/. Here we will first discuss the topological argument, after which we will consider the prequisites for and the geometrical argument itself in Section 3 and 4.\n\nBy focussing on the homotopy notion of equivalent paths, we release ourselves from the burden of having to examine each individual path and instead are able to focus on features of the /space/. Specifically, since we only need whether two paths are continuously deformed into one another, we just need to look at whether the space allows for such trickyness. This feature of a space is called its *connectedness*. A space is called *simply connected* iff all /loops/ can be deformed into a point, like in figure ref:fig:connectedness. For our purposes, since we are looking at the position of a particle in spacetime, we can consider a space to be simply connected if it has no holes. Here a hole is a hole that \"pierces\" the space: the handle in the \"space\" of a coffeecup and the hole in the \"space\" of a donut are prime examples, while the inside of a bottle or a bubble in a glass of coke do not count as \"holes\" for the sake of connectedness. On the contrary, spaces with such holes are called /multiply-connected/, or sometimes more simply /non-simply-connected/ spaces.\n\nThis concept of connectedness allows us to understand the main assumption behind the handwavey argument above: we return to the same position after rotating 2\\pi if the space is simply connected, because \"being the same\" means \"being the same path\" and \"being the same path\" means \"being able to continuously deform them to each other\" and \"doing nothing\" is the \"point path\" and you are only able to shrink all paths to a point in a simply connected space. This, of course, raises the question: is the configuration space of two identical particles always simply connected, i.e., why do should we return to the same system after rotating $2\\pi$? As we will see, it is simply connected in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but /not/ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is why people say that anyons can only exist in 2D. As we will also see, however, is that this is not strictly true, as we can conceive of somewhat plausible multiply-connected 3D spaces.\n\n[fn:7] Note that this does not directly follow: it could also be the case that particles just sometimes have -1 and other times +1. Empirically, however, we find no such distinction, only dependent on particle type.\n\n[fn:8] The other framework for considering such exchange is in terms of exchanging all the relevant quantum numbers, effectively mathematically swapping the particles. We shall see that this does not work for defining anyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Phase\n\nMuch of the upcoming section will be centered around calculating the /phase/ of a quantum system, and it will be useful to briefly go over what we mean by phase and its relation to anyons. Briefly stated, the phase factor is a complex number which does not change the physical information if applied globally, that is when multiplying every wavefunction under consideration with it. The $\\pm1$ applied by our operator $P$ is such a phase.\nPhase arises because the empirical outcome of measuring a quantum state involves calculating the modulo-squared of the wavefunction. There are simply (at least) two wavefunctions which arrive at the same outcome if you square them with their complex conjugate: - that wavefunction and plus that wavefunction. They are both perfectly fine mathematical representations of the same state, just like the fact that the square root of 9 can be both -3 and 3. When asked: what is the length of the side of a square field of 9 square meters, the answer is indeterminate: it can be either 3 or -3. Rather than saying it can only be positive, we can be a bit more general and say that the \"phase factor\" in front of the three is unphysical: it simply does not matter for calculating the surface area of the field what  it is. We have, of course, some empirical preference for using positive lengths in stead of negative ones, but we do not such physical intuitions for wave functions, as they live in Hilbert Space and we unfortunately only have 4D spacetime to our disposal. Since wavefunctions live in /complex/ Hilbert space, the most general factor that would get $||^2$ away is not $\\pm 1$, but $e^{i\\theta}$, as that simply /is/ the square root of $1$ in $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus any wavefunction will show empirical differences when multiplied with $e^{i\\theta}\\quad\\forall\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\nIt is of course not immediately clear what this has to do with paths in configuration space or anyons for that fact. The answer is that, while systems could theoretically obtain any phase, they do not in general do so. We know from examining the time-dependent Schrodinger equation that it can be reduced to the time-/independent/ schrodinger equation times a phase factor, which depends on time and the energy of the system. However, while we said that phase does not matter physically, this is only the case for the system as a whole: if two systems have different phase they interfere. It's analogous measuring any other kind of wave: you will have to pick a starting point in order to describe the offset of a particular wave. These phases don't matter until you measure two waves interfering, which leads to inteference. For particles this leads to destructive interference for fermions: if the exact same wave would =xxxxxxxxxx= then there is probability zero of it being there. This is the Pauli-exclusion principle.\n\nThus while phases do not appear to matter /prima faciae/, they are the reason matter is able to exist in the first place! Without the Pauli Exclusion Principle it would not be possible for matter to clump together, as everything would simply phase through each other (barring electromagnetic interactions).\n\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]] :level 2\n\n\n** The configuration space explanation for anyons\n\nThe topological explanation gestured at above consists of roughly the following steps:\n1. Construct the /configuration space/ of the system, that is, all possible positions our particle pair could be in.\n2. Find all possible homotopy equivalent paths, and, by extension, the /fundamental group/ of the space.\n3. Derive the 1D-representation of that group, that is, a scalar representing that group. This is the phase-factor.\n\nWe will go through these steps in detail for the case of anyons and other particles. After showing that anyons appear to only be possible in 2D, we construct a toy 3D-configuration space in which anyons are also possible.\n\n\n*** The 3D case\n**** Constructing the configuration space\nOur first task is to construct the configuration space for the exchange of $N$ identical particles in $3D$, after which we will examine its topological properties. The most general configuration space we can construct is one for $N$ particles living in $d$ dimensions, which would be\n \n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbb{R}^d_1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_2 ... \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_N\n    \\label{eq:Ndconfig}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (1)$$\n\nWe shall for now focus on just two particles in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which would be the configuration space occupied by two $3$-dimensional vectors $(r_1, r_2)$ representing two particles\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3  \\]\nAs we are dealing with identical particles, however, we need to add some extra structure, which results in our configuration space being much smaller than the above.\n\nTo simplify our notation and avoid having to conceptualize $9$-dimensional space, we can define our configuration space in terms of the center of mass of the particles $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1+r_2})}{2}$ and their difference vector $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r_1-r_2}$. Clearly the configuration space of $(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r})$ is still $\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. However, now we can pull a trick. We only care about exchanging the particles, right? It seems reasonable, therefore, that the position of the system as a whole does not play in a role in determining all possible positions of the particle, e.g. it should not matter (we assume, quite reasonably) whether we exchange two fermions in our lab on Earth or on Venus. For our purposes, then, we can safely ignore one of the two $\\mathbb{R}^3$s and simply focus on the relative distance and orientation of the two particles with each other.[fn:9] This simplifies the problem of finding the configuration space significantly.\n\nLet us return to the constraints. The first constraint is the indistinguishability of the particles. Since it is impossible to distinguish the situation $(r_1,r_2)$ from $(r_2,r_1)$, we cannot take these two configurations to be separate points in configuration space and must remove them. We can represent this by \"dividing out\" the permutation group $S_2$ from our current configuration space,[fn:10] yielding\n\\[\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^3 }{S_2}\\]\n\nThe second and final constraint is accounting for particles not being able to intersect with each other. The argument for /why/ we ought to, however, is rarely made precise. The general tendency, as by\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n[fn:9] Another way of thinking about this is to consider one particle to be fixed and the other moving around it.\n\n[fn:10] This makes it somewhat difficult to visually relate the \"one particle standing still\" picture to what the configuration space actually represents. Roughly, you can imagine it as the \"moving\" particle returning back to its original position after a rotation of $\\pi$ radians.\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect\n\nSo, anyons are claimed to be observed in 2D only.\nHowever, some claim that anyons are observed [@Bartolomei2020]  in actual systems. Does this mean that those systems are /actually/ two dimensional? This would go against much of our general intuition about systems.\n- Physisists claim that these systems are /approximatley/ or /effectively/ 2D (=sources=).\n- Following [@Norton2012], we know how to interpret this: we can demote an idealization to an approximation if we are able to show that there is a smooth limit.\n- This is exactly the problem, according to [@Shech2019]: the topological explanation of anyons requires an /exact/ 2D system (or a rather ad-hoc 2D system as we saw).\n- Therefore we cannot call this approximately 2D.\n- According to [@Shech2019], this is a problem for those with nominalist inclinations[fn:1], as the instantiation of abstract mathematical structures in the real world would be an issue.\n  - Such an argument can only be made, however, through the use of the EIA which was discussed in the previous (or next?) chapter.\n- Therefore, it would do such people well to examine the physical effect thoroughly for any signs of this.\n\n\n\nLuckily, hope is on the horizon: it turns out that the computations of the phase of the alledged anyons in the FQHE uses a geometrical notion rather than a topological notion of phase.\n- Unluckily, this geometrical notion also relies on a two dimensional idealization.\n- However, this idealization /could/ conceivably be demoted to an approximation.\n\nIn this chapter, we will examine the inner working of the Quantum Hall Effect. This is needed in order to understand the following\n1. Why do people say that these particles are anyons\n2. What idealizations are made in the explanation of the quantum hall effect separate from the topological one.\n3. ...\n\nReaders less interested in the details can skip to the last subsection of this section =link= and the next section =link=.\n\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect is the quantum version of the classical hall effect, a rather straightforward consequence of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. It was discovered all the way back in =XXXX= by Edwin Hall, who claimed it a novelty which would never have any use-case. Today Hall-Effect sensors are widely used to pick up magnetic fields and rotations of conducting materials. More esoteric applications are as potential long-term space-travel propellants in so-called Hall-Effect thrusters, which are a specific form of ion propolsion, which can generate a low thrust for a very long amount of time.\n\nThe basics of the effect are rather simple\n- Strip which has current flowing through it.\n- Magnetic field perpendicular to that strip\n- Induces Lorentz force which pushes particles to one side, increasing their concentration and creating a potential difference, inducing a voltage changing the resistivity.\n- This resistivity linearly depends on the voltage, which linearly depends on the concentration difference which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field, thus yielding a linear dependence of the resistivity to the strenght of the perpendicular magnetic field.\n- Looks like figure ref:fig:che\n\nHowever, as most classical effects, they only hold in a certain regime. When we clean up the materials, lower the temperature dramatically (<2K) and increase the magnetic field strength considerably, we observe the /Quantum Hall Effect/ (QHE): rather than a linear dependence on the magnetic field strength, the resistivity shows these strange plateaux at rather consistent values, as in ref:fig:qhe. The spacing between these plateaux does not seem to differ between different materials, which is even more curious.\n\nSo: why? Why do we see these plateaux, and why at these levels? The short answer (partially) is: the impurities in the sample lift the degeneracy of the eigenstates of the Quantum Hall system, called Landau levels, and /localizes/ some of those states, rather than the states extending from one edge of the sample to the other (akin to the wavefunctions of a particle in a box). These localized states do not conduct current (as do not span the system, and resistivity is measured from end to end), thus leading to the plateaux in the resistivity: we change plateaux when all the localized states are filled and we move to different extended states. The specific values of these levels depend on weird physics at the boundaries of the system called /edge-modes/, but in short the levels correspond to the number of filled Landau levels: at higher magnetic field strengths the levels can accommodate more states, thus the lower the magnetic field strength the larger the number of available levels, leading to a smooth-looking linear dependence in the classical regime.\n\nThere are quite some caveats to the above story, but that is the gist of why the effect happens for /integer levels/. The less interested reader can skip over the following section describing the corresponding /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/ (IQHE) and head to the description of its fractional cousin, where the same does not hold. Specifically, the IQHE requires one massive idealization: electron interaction is neglected completely. As we shall see, this idealization cannot hold in the FQHE.\n\n[fn:1] If the reader was not aware of this yet, the author does hold such inclinations.\n\n** The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\nIn order to do as little physics as is possibly required, I will skip most of the justification for the quantum formalism of the QHE (quantizing the classical Hamiltonian, finding the commutators) and many of the intermediate steps to arrive at the relevant results. I point the interested reader to [@Tong2016][[]] for a quite accessible and to [@Arovas2020] for a more thorough pedagogical discussion of these issues, and to [@Stone1992; @Prange1987; @Doucot2005] for rather complete, less pedagogical sources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) is the observation of plateaux in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ at regular intervals. These intervals happen to be integer multiples of the /quantum of resistance/  $R_q=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2}$. =check whether this is so=\n- This is rather curious, why so precise?\n- In fact, so precise that these experiments are used to determine the quantum of resistance.\n- Why are they there, and why at those levels?\n\nAs physicists, the first thought as to the origin of these plateaux probably goes to the energy eigenstates of the system, which turns out to be correct! The plateaux correspond to the general energy eigenstates of a system of charged particles moving in a perpendicular magnetic field, so called Landau levels.\n- It will be difficult to properly understand the QHE without first briefly going over landau levels.\n\n=Assumptions=\n\n*** Landau Levels\n\nHere we already start to sneak in our idealizations: we will treat this system as if it is two dimensional. =However, this system can be easily extended to 3D, see XXXX=\n\nThe simplest Hamiltonian for a system of particles moving in a magnetic field is\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2} m(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} +e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} )^2\n    \\label{eq:landauham}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (2)$$\n\nThe  magnetic field is perpendicular to the $x,y$-plane, so we define the vector potential $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}$ using our knowledge that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane $\\nabla\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=B \\hat{z}$, to be\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\nxB\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n    \\label{eq:landaugauge}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (3)$$\n\n=This will be appendix=\nThe easiest way to find the energy eigenstates is the way all Hamiltonians get solved: treat is as the harmonic oscillator. As the Hamiltonian of the \"normal\" harmonic oscillator is\n\n\n..\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x - i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for $\\pi$ then tell us that $a$ and $a^\\dagger$ obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n\\[H= \\frac{1}{2}m \\pi^2   = \\omega_B \\left( a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2}  \\right)\\]\nWe find that the energy eigenlevels are\n\\[\\ket{n}=\\omega_B\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\n*** Calculating the degeneracy\n\nWe started by saying that the plateaux in the IQHE correspond to the various filled Landau levels of the simple particle in a magnetic field system. We still need to prove this, namely by deriving the conductivity for the Hall states. This can get rather messy, so I will show put the derivation for a single particle here, and the more general derivation of the so called /Kubo formula/ in the Appendix.\n\n=sloppy=\n\nTo find the resistivity, we use Ohm's law, which relates the energy of a particle to the current density (current over area)\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{E}=\\sigma \\mathbf{J}\n    \\label{eq:ohm}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (4)$$\n\nOur mechanical momentum is\n\\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} = m \\hat{\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}}\\]\nClassically, the current (for a single particle) is simply $\\mathbf{I}=-e\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}$, but isnce we are working quantum mechanically we take the expectation value\n\n\\[I=-e/m \\sum_filled_states \\bra{\\psi}-i\\hbar\\nabla+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\ket{\\psi} \\]\n\nWe are working in Landau gauge.\n\n...\n\nWe end up with\n*** Edge modes\n\nIn order to provide a more thorough calculation (i.e. not just considering a single electron) we take advantage of a the fact that the system is bounded. I will not reproduce this here.\n\n\n*** Robutsness\n\nThe explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\nThis is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness.\n\nExperimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Figure 1: <<fig:disorder>>Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:disorder\n[[file:./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n#+caption: Figure 2: <<fig:extended>>Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:extended\n[[file:./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (5)$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    | \\Delta V | <<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} |\n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (6)$$\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.=\n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=.\n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see [@Tong2016]\n\n\nThat is it for the IQHE, as we derived the two things we needed from it: we gained a general understanding of why the plateaux have their values (they are the energy eigenvalues of the Landau levels) and, more importantly, we roughly understand why these plateaux are robust.\nUnfortunately, this is not the end of the story, we did not even mention anything topological yet! For that we finally turn to the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.\n\n[fn:5] Improved performance of impure 2D materials is an active area of research in material science, see [@Wang2020] for a summary of how impurities enhance the conductivity of graphene.\n\n[fn:6] The non-dirty sample just discussed is a great example of taking an idealization too seriously: we cannot explain the phenomena in the idealized setting, and have to retrofit extra physics on top of the idealization in order to get a satisfying explanation, only for us to then show in the limit of no impurities we regain our initial idealization. If this limit would not have been smooth (it fortunately is), we would have wasted all this time!\n\n\n** The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nFollowing the naming convention of the IQHE, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) refers to the observation of plateaux at /fractional/ values of the quantum of resistance in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$. Sadly, very few of the arguments mentioned above will be able to explain these plateaux, as we have only shown that they appear at fully filled Landau levels. However, our intuition about the robustness will still hold.\n\n\nThe goal of this expos\\'e is twofold. First we want to gain a general understanding of how the FQHE is thought about in general: what assumptions go into calculating the relevant parameters, which idealizations are noteworthy, etc. The other main goal is the 'derivation' of the Laughlin wavefunction, the wavefunction used to describe the FQH system, and its excitations. At the end we will arrive at the problem of calculating the exchange statistics of these excitations, which turn out to be /anyons/, but not actually compute them yet: this will be done in section ref:sec:GeometricPhase.\n\n\nThe key difference between the description of the Fractional as opposed to the Integer Quantum Hall effect is the inclusion of electron interactions in the former, which becomes impossible to ignore at the energy scales above $\\nu=1$, which is where most of the FQHE physics is done. As a result the reasoning cannot be as rigorous as before. In the IQHE we could pretend that all the states occupied the same Landau level, which allowed us to calculate the wavefunctions and energy levels, leading to the derivation of the Hall resistivity and confirm our suspicion that the plateaux correspond to fully filled Landau levels. Only after doing that did we let go of that idealization and allow the degeneracy to be lifted in order to argue that the plateaux were robust.\n\nThis order of operation is no longer possible in the FQHE, as the electron interactions lift the degeneracy of the Landau levels from the start, forcing us to compute the wavefunctions in a different way. A first approach would be to use perturbation theory: model the electron interaction as a small perturbation to ref:eq:landauham and then gradually compute a better and better approximation to the actual wavefunction. While this is fine for simple two-electron systems, the number of electrons in a QH system is closer to $10^{23}$. That is a rather large matrix to diagonalize, not even close to possible to do numerically. Therefore, we need to pull some tricks.\n\nThe trick is: do not compute the wave function, just write one down. That is exactly what [@Laughlin1983] did, yielding what we now call the *Laughlin wavefunction*\n\n[[file:20210311182300-the_laughlin_wavefunction.org][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]\n\nLaughlin of course did not just simply write down a bunch of wavefunction and pick the one he liked best, it is motivated by some observations from the system and from some general conditions we have to place on any wavefunction. Specifically, in a previous paper [@Laughlin1983a] he derived the wavefunctions for three particles in the FQHE. Recapping this in the case of two electrons is worthwhile.\n\nWe have a system of two electrons with a potential $V(|r_1-r_2|)$.\n- To solve such systems, it's easiest to work with angular momentum.\n- If we want to work with angular momentum, the gauge we picked before (Landau Gauge) is not very useful, as it does not include any kind of rotation\n  - Instead we pick /symmetric gauge/, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\times \\mathbf{B}= -yB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + xB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n- Skipping multiple steps ahead, we see that the wavefunctions look like\n\nUnfortunately this does not uniquely or straightforwardly generalize to N particles, so we have to pull a few more tricks.\n1. We do try to generalize, and say that a wavefunction for N particles will look something like $f(z)e^{something}$\n2. We /insist/ that the wavefunction be in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) it can possibly be: there are no other Landau levels it can fall back on. This is rather strong. This leads to the claim that $f(z)$ /must/ be analytic. =how=\n3. Since the state will have to describe fermions, the wave function must be anti-symmetric under exchange of the particles, which requires $f(z)$ to be odd.\n4. Finally, since we need to conserve angular momentum, we require that =f(z) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree M, where M is the total angular momentum.=\n\nAll these constraints add up to the fact that $f(z)=\\prod_{j<k}(z_j-z_k)^m$, with $m$ odd.\n*This is what people mean when they say that the LWF falls into the same universality class as the actual wavefunction, as any wavefunction needs to account for this.[fn:3]*\n\nWell, neat, you might say, but this still just describes fermions, I thought we were going to be talking about anyons!

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\nThis might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n** 1.4 Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons. If we were to examine the anyons first .....\n\n* The quantum hall effect\n** Once again, what is it\n*** Classical Hall effect\n\n[[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\n*** Preliminaries\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n\n To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n**** Dawdling\n\nNow that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n*** Integer vs Fractional\n\nInteger is somewhat interesting but only insofar as it allows us to sort of get why the plateuax are there, although this explanation does not really work for the FQHE as it does not take electron interactions into account which are crucial\n#BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n\n** IQHE\n*** Landaus\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223165225-landau_levels_in_an_electric_field.org][Landau levels in an electric field]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223160810-derivation_of_landau_levels_for_qhe.org][derivation of Landau levels for QHE]]\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*** Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\nImpurities\n\n\n\n\n However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample.

In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\nDo this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n\"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality \\eqref{eq:perturbation} to hold.\n\nIdeally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\nTo see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\n(note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\nThe handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n\\]\nIf we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n. However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\nNow, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\nTo get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n* The explanation of anyons\n\n  #+include: \"./20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org\" :minlevel 4\n\n[[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]]\n\n#+include: \"./20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org\" :minlevel 4\n[[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n** TODO \n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210414155705-proof_ballspace_is_not_simply_connected.org][Proof ballspace is not simply connected]]\n\n#+transclude: t :level 2\n[[file:20210414155524-how_does_qm_work_in_non_simply_connected_space.org][How does QM work in non-simply connected space?]]\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210414155618-how_to_justify_particles_not_being_able_to_escape.org][How to justify particles not being able to escape]]\n\n* Footnotes\n\n[fn:3] The spin-statistics theorem is only provable in relativistic quantum mechanics.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\nThis might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n** 1.4 Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons. If we were to examine the anyons first .....\n\n* The quantum hall effect\n** Once again, what is it\n*** Classical Hall effect\n\n[[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\n*** Preliminaries\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n\n To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n**** Dawdling\n\nNow that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n*** Integer vs Fractional\n\nInteger is somewhat interesting but only insofar as it allows us to sort of get why the plateuax are there, although this explanation does not really work for the FQHE as it does not take electron interactions into account which are crucial\n#BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n\n** IQHE\n*** Landaus\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223165225-landau_levels_in_an_electric_field.org][Landau levels in an electric field]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 4\n[[file:20210223160810-derivation_of_landau_levels_for_qhe.org][derivation of Landau levels for QHE]]\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*** Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\nImpurities\n\n\n\n\n However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample.

In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\nDo this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n\"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here!

We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\n(note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\nThe handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n\\]\nIf we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n. However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\nNow, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\nTo get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n* The explanation of anyons\n\n  #+include: \"./20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org\" :minlevel 4\n\n[[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]]\n\n#+include: \"./20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org\" :minlevel 4\n[[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n** TODO \n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210414155705-proof_ballspace_is_not_simply_connected.org][Proof ballspace is not simply connected]]\n\n#+transclude: t :level 2\n[[file:20210414155524-how_does_qm_work_in_non_simply_connected_space.org][How does QM work in non-simply connected space?]]\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210414155618-how_to_justify_particles_not_being_able_to_escape.org][How to justify particles not being able to escape]]\n\n* Footnotes\n\n[fn:3] The spin-statistics theorem is only provable in relativistic quantum mechanics.

Instead, it is sufficient to focus on one necessary feature of idealizations: they /falsely/ represent one or more features of the real world in order to ease calculation or reasoning (are these all the things people do with models? reasoning is pretty broad so should be safe). This mirrors the major issue with boundary drawing/discretization, namely that some boundary is drawn in order to facilitate reasoning about some object or concept, when identifying or justifying that boundary is difficult. The shared difficulty, then, consists in justifying either the use or reality of such simplifications.\n\nHowever, common descripitions/(word) of idealization specifically include the fact that they introduce a /false/ description, which is not something we ought to assume about the boundary drawing problem, as doing so would beg the question. Instead we will take the by now familiar stance of examining /how, if at all/ the use or legitimacy of idealizations is justified, and hopefully extrapolate from there.\n\n*** Characterizations of idealization?\n\nCharacterizations of idealizations are abound in the literature, although few dare claim to provide an exhaustive one. The most discussed are cite:Norton2012 's characterization of idealization as opposed to approximation:\n- Approximation: proposition which sort of describes the target\n- Idealization: model whose properties sort of describe the target\n\nNorton's standard example is a ball falling through the atmosphere. We have an excellent formula for calculating the velocity $v(t)$ starting at $v=t=0$ as\n\\[\nv(t)=\\frac{g}{k}(1-\\exp(-kt))=gt-\\frac{gkt^2}{2}+\\frac{gk^2t^3}{6}-\\ldots\n\\]\nwhere $g$ is the accelaration due to gravity, and $k$ a friction coefficient.\n\nAs any physics student knows, it is often convenient to leave out the influence of air resistance. Setting $k=0$ gives us\n\\[\nv(t)=gt\n\\]\n\nGiven Norton's distinction, we can look at the above formula in two ways, either as an approximation or as an idealization. If we view it as an approximation i.e. a proposition describing the actual system inexactly, we can say that this is a good approximation for the first part of the ball's descent, becoming a worse and worse approximation as the ball continues to fall. We could also view it as an idealization, in which case we view the above equation as representing a (false) model of a ball falling in a vacuum. It is not the description of this model that is false, rather the model (idealization) misrepresents our world in some way, namely by leaving out air.\n\nIn this example the differnce between an approximation and an idealization is simply a point of view: we can freely shift the characterization of the formula as an approximation or idealization. The \"shifting\" Norton calls promotion and demotion respectively. Promotion consists in taking the approximation to describe a new, idealized model, while demotion is extracting one or more inexact propositions from an existing idealization.  I mention this now because it will come in handy later.\n\nOther descriptions are due to cite:Strevens2007, which characterizes idealizations more similarly to how I did above, as deliberate falsifications of reality. Specifically, Strevens conceptualizes idealizations in terms of the operation behind them: setting a parameter to zero, infinity, or some other number.\n\n*** Why do we not consider the target system an idealization? It's also a model\n\n*** Is idealization different than abstraction?\n\n** Not focus on idealizations as a whole but on infinite idealizations\n\nAs is tradition by now, I wish to focus on a subsection of idealizations first in order to get a better grasp on them. Idealization as construed above does not differ that much from a model, indeed Norton even seems to treat them as synonyms. Analyzing models on their own is difficult, and since idealizations are difficult to distinguish from models entirely, analyizing idealizations on their own will in all likelihood also turn out to be difficult. Therefore let us turn to a more problematic example of idealization, one which has more easily identifiable examples: infinite idealizations.\n\nInfinite idealizations (also called \"asymptotic idealizations\" by for instance cite:Strevens2019 or \"asymptotic explanation\" by for instance cite:Batterman2005) are, put crudely, an idealization which is arrived at through some sort of limiting operation, through which a parameter of the original model is made to approach infinity[fn:infinitesimal]. Commonly discussed examples in the literature are the thermodynamic limit (TDL), the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), the Aharanov Bohm effect, infinite population models ....\n\nAs promised, infinite idealizations run into more obvious problems more quickly: in the thermodynamic limit the number of particles goes to infinity, the FQHE posits 2D particles, the AB effect requires an infinitely long solenoid and in order to explain gene distribuitions biologists assume infinite populations. /Prima facie/, the problem appears straightforward: such things do not exist. \"Can you show me an infinitely long solenoid?\", the detractor exclaims. However, why does this appear so problematic? After all, was intentional misrepresentation not the characterizing feature of idealizations? Why is setting air resistance to $0$ less problematic than setting the $z$-axis to $0$?\n\n...\n\n** Characterizations of infinite idealizations\n (This is the important part, where everything before this is more an idea of how I would fit it in the rest of my thesis)\n*** Norton\n\nFirst in cite:Norton2012 and more in depth in cite:Norton2014, Norton describes his unease with so called \"infinite idealizations\". Although never providing a strict definition, we can make an educated guess to one:\n\n*Infinite Idealization (Norton):*\n\nAn infinite idealization is made by performing a limiting operation on an idealized system, taking some parameter (such as length, number, volume) to either zero or infinity. The infinite idealization is the system with the parameter /set/ to zero or infinity. However, sometimes these systems misbehave by either the limit not obtaining or conflicting, which is bad.\n\nThis characterization somewhat goes against the limit of what Norton intends to argue, namely that such infinite idealizations are not idealizations at all, but can only be sensibly understood as /approximations/ as defined above. For \"the essential starting point of the notion of idealization is that we have a consistently describably system, even if it is fictitious.\"cite:Norton2014 pp. 200   However, I am not willing to grant that condition just yet, so for now we will refer to these systems as infinite idealizations.\n\nNorton furthermore distinguishes between well-behaved and ill-behaved idealizations.[fn:well-behaved] Ill-behaved idealizations are infinite idealizations whose limit system (the system with the parameter /set/ to zero or infinity) does not match with target system in some way. This mismatch can take two forms cite:Norton2012 (3.2, 3.3): the limit system might not exist, e.g. an infinite sphere, or the limit system might have a property which conflicts with a property of the target system. For the former, if we define a sphere as all points which are equidistant from some other point, then an infinite sphere does not exist, as there are no points at infinity. ($\\mathbb{R}=(-\\infty, \\infty)$ not tt$[-\\infty,\\infty]$) For the latter, Norton imagines modelling an arbitarily long ellipsoid as an infinite cylinder. While they look similar, the ratio of surface to volume for an ellipsoid is different than that for a cylinder, so the idealization has a fundamental mismatch.\n\nIn short: for Norton infinite idealization simply is the end result of the process of a limiting operation. Furthermore, these idealizations can sometimes be well behaved, and sometimes ill-behaved.\n\n*** Strevens\n\ncite:Strevens2019a defines infinity (or \"asymptotic\" as he likes to call it, we will stick with infinite here) idealizations slightly differently than Norton. Luckily, Strevens does provide a clear definition, which is in contrast to what he calls a \"simple\" idealization, which \"is ahieved by the straightforward operation of setting some parameter or parameters in the model to non-actual values, often zero\". A clear example is the air-resistance coeffient above. At first, he constrast this straightforwardly with infinite idealizations in the Norton sense, as \"in asymptotic idealization, by contrast, a fiction is introduced by taking some sort of limit\". This definition can be taken to be identical with Norton's.\n\nHowever, later on in the paper he adds an additional layer to the definition, (TODO find a good quote for this) namely that infinite idealizations are made when it is not possible to use a simple idealization to directly the relevant property to zero (or infinity). Furthermore, he adds, \"Asymptotic idealization is an interesting proposition, then, only in those cases where a simple substitution cannot be performed, which is to say only in those cases where a veridical model for mathematical reasons falls apart or otherwise behaves badly at the limiting value.\" While Strevens later argues why these interesting cases (Norton's mismatches) /do/ make sense, we do not have to concern us with evaluating that just yet, we simply need to note that Strevens makes the same distinction as Norton here. Then, we can define\n\n*Infinite Idealization (Strevens):*\n\nAn infinite idealization is made by performing a limiting operation on a system, taking some \"extrapolation\" parameter (such as length, number, volume) to either zero or infinity *in order to set some other parameter to zero or infinity.* The infinite idealization is the system with the extrapolation parameter and the relevant paramenter set to either zero or infinity (dont' need to be the same). However, sometimes these systems misbehave, *which is interesting*.\n(bold to highlight differences with Norton)\n\nBatterman also has some definition but it is rather vague.\n\n** Why this is confusing\n\nI am not satisfied with definitions, as they contain too many different relevant pieces of information such as whether they misbehave, how they do the operation and what kind of subset they form of idealizations in general. I believe that the discussion of infinite idealization would be much clearer if we distinguished between the factors that contribute to the problem, as follows.\n\n** A Categorization of Idealization\n\nFocusing on the discussion of infinite idealizations solely, I believe 4 (maybe 5) distinctions can be drawn. I will first present the distinctions, and then show how I believe they are ordered. The goal is to create categories for (infinite) idealizations to facilitate reasoning and argument, since, as we have seen above, Norton and Strevens are not per se arguing over the same definition, even if it is close.\n\n*** Simple vs. Infinite Idealizations\n\nIn Strevens and less explicitly in Norton, the discussion is presented as being about this distinction, but actually concerns a subclass of infinite idealizations we shall discuss below. However, the simple vs. infinite distinction is a useful one, but I will draw it differently than Strevens.\na) /Simple Idealization/.\n    A simple idealization is an idealization in which no limit is taken in order to set the relevant parameter.\nb) /Infinite Idealization/.\n   An infinite idealization is one in which a limit is taken in order to set a parameter.\n\nNote that no reference has been made to whether or not it affects another parameter, or whether the limit operation is succesful. I argue that this is first and foremost the distinction between these idealizations, and that other qualities should be discussed separately. (I am not sure whether idealizations can be split up neatly into two disjoint sets like these (I'm not sure if that can be done at all, see cite:WEBER2010 ), but i'll just treat it like it does)\n\nThis is a distinction based on /method/: /how/ is the idealization achieved? The idealized system might end up the same in some cases, but the operation is the relevant piece.\n\n*** Direct vs. Indirect Idealizations\n\nThis distinction is also due to Strevens, although he does not discuss it separately and makes it co-refering(?) with the first distinction. Direct idealizations, as the name implies, directly alter the relevant parameter e.g. setting air resitance to zero in order to have zero air resistance.  Indirect idealizations on the other hand, alter a parameter in order to alter the actually relevant parameter, e.g. infinite population in order to set genetic drift to zero, or infinite particles in order to achieve a singularity.\n\nThis is a distinction based on /goal/: /what/ should the idealization achieve? Indirect idealizations are sometimes necessary in order to get rid of a pesky parameter. Note that while this is an intention based distinction, in some models the same parameter might be set directly or indirectly. While in Newtonian Mechanics we might set the air resistance to zero directly, in a more complete QFT description of the same situation we have no access to such a parameter.\n\nAlso note that this distinction is not the same as the one between infinite and simple idealizations: as Strevens notes, it is completely in the realm of possibility to directly set a parameter to zero using an infinite limiting operation, \"but you would merely be showing off.\"\n\nAdditionally, only infinite ideazations can be indirect, but not all are.\n\n*** Unproblematic/boring vs. problematic/interesting\n\n(not sure what to call this yet, should be catchy)\nThis distinction is both due to Strevens and Norton, and is what I believe the main distinction we ought to discuss. This distinction is only relevant for *indirect infinite* idealizations, as both Norton and Strevens agree that all direct and simple idealizations provide little puzzlement. Indirect infinite idealizations can be boring i.e. there is no mismatch with the idealized system and the target system (I have no example), or interesting, by creating such a mismatch. All the idealizations under discussion fall under this category.\n\nThis is a distinction based on /result/: /what/ is the idealization like? (Not too sure about this characterization, not very catchy)\n\n*** Absent vs. Contradictory\n\n(also unsure about these names) (other idea self-contradictory and \"external\"-contradictory? extracontradictory?)\nThis distinction is due to Norton, as Strevens does not explicitly distinguish between the two. This distinction only concerns *interesting idealizations*. For absent idealizations, the idealized model system simply cannot exist in its own terms: an infinite sphere does not denote anything. Contradictory idealizations, on the other hand, postulate some property of the model system which conficts with another property we hold to be incontrovertible, or at least uncontroversial. Most of the idealizations under discussion fall under this category: infinite populations are not self contradictory, but they prevent probabilistic reasoning using uniform distributions.\n\nThis is a distinction based on ???\n\n*** Putative distinctions\n\nThere are two more distinctions of which I am not sure I can genuinely draw them.\n\n**** Quantitative vs qualitative mismatch/contradiction.\n- Quantitative\n  Here I mean Norton's ellipsoid elongating to a cylinder: the mismatch comes from the ellipsoid having a certain volume/surface ratio in all finite stages, but a different one when infinitely long. No property is set to zero or infinity, unless you count \"cylinderness\".\n- Qualitative\n  Some property becomes true or false in the infinite limit which is not false or true in the finite case. Most of the actual examples are here: having or not having phase transitions, being 2D or 3D, exhibiting or not exhibiting an effect\n\n  The reason I doubt this distinction is because I feel like it's a question of framing. A very important question, which I should investigate, but not a distinction of kind per se.\n\n**** Logical/transcendental contradiction vs a physical/intuitive contradiction.\n\nThe former is exemplified by Streven's infinite population example: the main problem is that for an infinite population it is no longer possible to have countable additivity with a uniform distribution, and so you cannot use the Strong Law of Large Numbers and could not say anything about the probability of genetic drift (might be badly paraphrasing): the method itself is no longer useful, but it's not a direct self-contradiction as the infinite sphere, as an infinite population is a sensible concept. The latter is a bit more vague, but here I mean e.g. the thermodynamic limit: it does not work because it stipulates an inifite number of particles. However, this is in conflict with the whole idea that the world is made up of molecules. BUT not directly so, as cite:Shech2013 points out, it is only a real paradox if we stipulate that statistical mechanics in the thermodynamic limit is a true/accurate representaiton of the world, which we need to justify by e.g. (or i.e.? I don't know of any others) an indispensability argument.\n\nThis is a distinction based on????\n\nI doubt this because the former category might refer to the same as \"absent\" idealizations.\n\n** Order of the distinctions\n\nI think the order is best explained by this beautiful diagram, the whole box being \"idealization-space\". Not included is how this is linked to approximations, nor the distinctions I am unsure about, this is simply to show how the above distinctions work:\n\n[[../HPS/Thesis/Beautiful_Images/idealization_distinctions.png]]\n\n** Discussion\n\n\nWhile these distinctions might appear nitpicky, I think they are vital for making sure we are discussing the correct problem. Additionally, in making these distinctions it became clear that perhaps more distinctions need to be made, such as the specific nature of the contradiction induced, see Section \\ref{sec:orgff730de}.\n\nWhat is clear is how infinite idealizations (the interesting ones at least) differ from idealizations in general or simple ones. Infinite idealizations are a subcategory of idealizations, together with simple idealizations (whether they completely fill the category of idealization is left open). However, the distinction between infinite idealizations and simple idealizations does not prove particularly enlightening. Other distinctions will be more fruitful to investigate.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\neg P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\lor \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

We turn on a constant magx I H V B, B pointing in the z-direction. Meanwhile, the electrons are restricted to move only in the (x, y)plane. A constant current I is made to flow in the x-direction. The Hall effect is the statement that this induces a voltage VH (H is for “Hall”) in the y-direction. This is shown in the figure= ref:chetong.\n#+caption: Classical Hall effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:chetong\n[[./media/chetong.png]]\n\nSince the voltage $V_H$ linearly depends on the Lorentz force, which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field $B$, $V_H$ linearly depends on $B$ and thus, classically, we expect the graph to look like Figure ref:linresistance. Similarly, we don't expect the resistance along the strip $\\rho_{xx}$ to vary either. =Bit more explanation for why we do not expect this=\n#+caption: caption Linear Resistance\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:linresistance\n[[./media/linresistance.png]]\n\nNote that for computational ease we are measuring and calculating the /resistivity/ along a certain axis rather than the voltage.\n\nHowever, as is often the case in physics, systems can behave rather differently from our classical expectations when put in extreme circumstances. These circumstances, in this case, include extremely low temperatures ($<2K$), strong magnetic fields ($>>1T$) and rather pure samples (but, as we shall see, not too pure either.) When these conditions are met, the graph looks something more like Figure ref:ifqhe\n\n#+caption: Integer and fractional effects\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ifqhe\n[[./media/fqhe.png]]\n\nAfter a certain magnetic field strength has been reached, these plateaux start to show up. The question then of course is: why?\n\n\n*** Preliminaries\n\n To understand why the QHE arises, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, unsurprisingly first described by Landau, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task. =Badly written=\n\n\n# **** Quantization\n# Not necessary according to Guido, which I agree with\n#+begin_comment\n=I'm over explaining here=\nThe (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels.

This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n#+end_comment\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nThere are not one but two quantum Hall effects: the integer and the fractional. Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[file:20210219124712-the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[[file:20210219125647-quantum_of_resistance.org][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin. In fact, we take the material to be so thin that it becomes $2D$. This choice will come back to haunt us, but it is (for now) the only way of understanding the effect.=\n\n   Naturally, a physicist, after obtaining these results, would ask: why are these plateaux there? We can split this question into two subquestions:\n1. Why are there plateaux at all?\n2. Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct! While not trivial, it turns out that these plateaux correspond to the spectrum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, whose energy levels are called [[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]. Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210223163548-landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection? Do the plateaux correspond to these energy levels?\n\n     Experimentally, we know that on one of these plateaux the transversal resistivity is\n     \\[\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2} \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\]\n     $\\nu$ being the /i/s in Figure ref:fig:iqhe.\n\n     From our =rough calculation=, we expect that this conductivity depends on the densitiy of electrons $n$\n     \\[\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{B}{ne} \\]\n\n     Equating the two, we get\n     \\begin{equation}\n    n=\\frac{Be}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\nu\n    \\label{eq:landaufilling}\n\\end{equation}\nas the number of electrons in unit area.\n\nIf we can show that the degeneracy of a Landau level is the same, we would be reasonably assured that the plateaus $\\nu$ occur when a $\\nu$ Landau levels are exactly filled.\n=I HAVE NOT SHOWN ANYTHING=\n\n\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n[[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210302154810-edge_modes_determine_the_values_of_the_iqhe_plateaux.org][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*Edge modes are very important, but sound rather mysterious. However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161230-iqhe_has_no_electron_interactions_fqhe_does.org][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [[file:20210309161322-reasoning_of_fqhe_is_less_rigorous_than_iqhe.org][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former.

In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\n Do this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n \"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality ref:eq:perturbation to hold.\n\n Ideally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n*** TODO Writing down the LWF\n\n This problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\n While this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n  Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\n To see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n where, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n (note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\n The handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[file:20210511130045-geometric_phase.org][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [[file:phase_factor.org][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protagonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n** Geometry?

This is not a new thought, but one I wish to explore in this thesis.\n\n** Specifically: words seem to denote a very precise ontological thing, but our epistemological capacities arent that precise\n\nI believe there exists a massive mismatch between the way we use language (names and/or concepts in particular) and how we conceptualize the ontology of the world. In short it is this: the _names_ we use for objects and _concepts_ in our language are discrete, while the space underlying them is continuous. That is, while we use names and concepts as if they have a definite _boundary_, there does not seem to be a clear line we can draw between the object and not-object, the concept and not-concept. Their boundary seems to be _vague_, indeterminate, fuzzy, etc.\n\n(this is not really a good example, I could start with \"human\" or \"the human that X\" or something. It's a much more familiar and vivid example, but it does veer into philosophy of biology more easily, so I'm weary to use it as a starting off point. Ideally I'd use a physics example but I don't have one that's quite so vidid as \"human\")\nNames and the objects they refer to are discrete in the way that one definite signifier is intented to represent one definite object or kind of object (natural kinds, I think): it is implied that the name refers to something with a definite spatio-temporal boundary. The problem of vagueness arises from the contrast between this proposed definiteness of boundary with the actual continuity of space, which does not lend itself to having distinct, point-like boundaries. In some cases this is more apparent than others. Take the name \"the football used in the 2016 world cup finals\" and the object it refers to, the actual football. The name implies, by use of \"the\", that there is one unique object, the actual football, it describes.\n\nAt first glance this appears uncontroversial: there is only one football which was used during the final, no exchanges were made and no \"multi-ball\" rule was suddenly introduced. The issue however is that we do not believe that footballs are fundamental constituents of reality, were there to be such things as fundamental consituents of reality. Instead we think that footballs are composed of smaller objects which may be fundamental consituents of reality, such as molecules, atoms, protons, quarks, and so forth. This fact leads to there not being a one to one mapping between the name \"the football used in the 2016 World Cup finals\" and a definite set of fundamental consituents of reality in a number of ways.\n\nThe first is a basic line drawing problem. This problem in fact already presents itself without thinking of the football as being composed of smaller consituents, as it is a consequence of the presumed continuity of space. It is not possible to pinpoint the exact location where the ball begins and ends, simply because it is not possible to measure a real number.\n\nThe second is due to specific physical theories: because of the uncertainty principle, there simply is no fact of the matter where the final electron belonging to the football and not to not-the-football is located in space, except of the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which is not per se popular.\n\nThe third and final issue with delineating the football is a more familiar matter: our idea of \"the football\" is not so fine-grained as to allow for the minute differences that happen to the football over the course of even a second. Kicking the football will result in some molecules separating from the main clump, perhaps adding some from the dirt, some of its atoms will decay, it will radiate away some heat and absorb some more: the exact state of the football changes across its life, second to second, moment to moment.\n\nThis third problem is best conceptualized using the Sorites paradox, which is not specific to names but to properties and concepts more generally as well. The basic idea can be summarized as follows: ten thousand grains of rice makes a heap of rice (or X collection of atoms make up \"the football\"). 9.999 grains of rice still make up a heap, as does 9,998. It appears that if N grains of rice make up a heap, then N-1 grains of rice also make up a heap. However, by mathematical induction, this would force us to conclude that any x grains of rice makes up a heap, including 1 grain of rice, which is patently false. To combat this, we can postulate that there exists a definite boundary between \"being a heap\" and \"not being a heap\". However, since the only way in which we can affect the heap is by adding or subtracting a grain of rice, this would lead to the other false conclusion that there exists an x such that X grains of rice do not make a heap while X+1 grains of rice do make a heap, which goes against the premises of the first argument: a true paradox.\n\n** I don't want to directly tackly meaning/vagueness/boundaries because it's hard. Instead I will look at physics because I know physics, and they sort of do this\n\nThese problems are deep and substantial, and while tackling them head on might be an option, I instead wish take a more roundabout route for exploring them by relating them to an area that explicitly deals with making precise denotations of an continuous mess: physics.\n\n** Physical Models/Idealization\n\nI take it as uncontroversial that physicists construct models, such as the Standard Model of Particle Physics, with a goal being to, at the very least, at some point make predictions about the outcomes of experiments. I furthermore take physics to be that what physicists do. Therefore one of the goals of physics is to construct models which make accurate predictions about the outcomes of experiments. This is a very conservative picture of physics.\n\n** Physics is a good case study as they use models which are analogous to the thing im interested in\n\nThe link between physics and the way words represent concepts becomes more clear when taking a slightly more ambitious stance towards the enterprise of physics, namely as constructing models which, in one or more aspects, _represent the world_. Representing an aspect of the world through a model is analogous to representing an object by a name, or more generally a concept by a word: continuous nature is fit into rigid molds. Investigating this link, therefore, might show us something about language more generally.\n\n** Too difficult on its own, let's just look at idealizations or abstractions\n\nHowever, attempting to evaluate how, if at all, physics represents \"reality\" directly proves no less difficult than attempting to determine that for words, concepts, objects, natural kinds etc. in general. Here, too, we need to narrow our scope to attack this question in any sensible way. I propose that the relevant aspect of physical modelling lies in its employment of idealizations and abstractions in order to simplify the mess that is continuous reality.\n\nAlthough the nature of idealizations and abstractions (henceforth I will just write idealization) will be spelled out in more detail later, it is worth noting some of its basic features and some similarities with the larger issue of denotation.\n\n\n(For the moment I will treat idealizations and abstractions as basically being the same thing, idealizations probably being more specific than abstractions. It is important and necessary to determine whether these do amount to the same thing however, see for instance cite:Shapiro2004, cite:mancosuAbstractionInfinity2016, cite:Lutz or cite:Knox2016 or cite:2016\nAlthough one clear difference does already spring to mind: idealizations are usually strictly false, while abstractions are more akin to generalizations, in that they are not false but simply cover more phenomena. Idealizations might not be a subtype of abstraction, but maybe a feature of it. I might start by introducing abstractions first, then focusing on idealizations later as a way to tackle that, but I am not sure of that step yet.)\n\n** Why should we pick idealizations\n\n   The solution is to pick specific aspects of a model that get close to the problem at hand. To this end I suggest using the idea of an \"idealization\", as idealizations are somewhat analogous to what I see as discreitziation, and are an import component of models. One of the key tasks will be to first flesh out the concept of an idealization, how necessary they are to models and how the relate to discretization. This will be done in chapter [[file:../../.local/share/Trash/files/20210106131334-chapter_idealizations_meta.org][Chapter Idealizations (meta)]]. I will specifically have a look at a subclass of idealizations: infinite or infinitesimal idealizations. This is because I believe they highlight what goes wrong with idealizations more clearly in a way that mirrors the general problem of discretization.\n\n** TODO Why Infinite idealizations\n*** Actual reason: (Shech makes this literal argument)\n*** What is an infinite idealization\n\nAn infinite idealization is an idealization in which some relevant property is set to 0 or infinity, rather than approximating it as being arbitrarily small or large.\n\n*** How does it differ from a normal idealization\n\nInfinite idealizations differ from \"normal\" or simple idealizations, to borrow cite:Strevens2019a 's terminology, in which a value is simply set to some other value.\n\n*** What's the goal of an infinite idealization\n\nFirst we must separate what an infinite idealization does from what it is meant to do.\n\n*** Infinite idealizations lead to problems\n**** Limit system does not exist\n**** Limit system disagrees with actual system\n** EIA\n*** Physical models and their idealizations are only a good case study if they are claimed to represent trutfully/literally\n\nThe relation between idealizations/abstractions and aspects of the world does not prove to be such a direct candidate for comparison between names and objects so easily, as there exists an important difference between the rough picture of physics sketched above and the question of how to match the discrete objects to continuous \"name space\": the models of physics do not per se truthfully represent the world, at least not until we stipulate such a thing. In contrast, when talking about the problem of discrete names not matching their continuous objects, the problem only arises when we imagine the word to truthfully represent the object, or, less strongly, to factor into true propositions about that object e.g. \"the football is round\". Similarly, models can only be used to study the boundary problem if we stipulate that the truthfully represent the world in some relevant aspect. (the relevant aspect quantifier is there because we do not expect our current models to grasp every relevant structure of the world, e.g. no emperically backed theory of quantum gravity exists as of yet.)\n\n*** Scientific realism claims that the idealizations truthfully represent\n\nFortunately, a rich philosophical tradition exists which espouses just the view that physical models truthfully represent, at least in some respect, the world: scientific realism. This tradition is no monolith however, and many competing and often incompatible interpretations exist, some more modest than others. More conservative, modern takes on the subject such as the structuralist realism espoused by James Ladyman and John Ross, are not easily said to believe that physical theories \"represent\" some relevant aspect of the world, rather they claim that such models \"latch on\" to relevant structures of the world, whatever they may be.\n\n*** The EIA as a case study/representative of scientific realism\n\nFor the purposes at hand, namely to elucidate how, if at all, the continuum can be discretized, it is more instructive to at least initially turn our gaze to stronger, more bold variations on scientific realism. The strongest seriously discussed version of scientific realism are based on Putnam-Quine style indispensability arguments, the \"naive\" version of which goes as follows:\n\n**** \"Naive\" Indispensability Argument\n\n    1. We ought to believe in the existence of those entities which are indispensable to our best scientific theories.\n    2. X is indispensable to our best scientific theories\n    C. We ought to believe in the existence of X\n\n   The \"naive\" is put in scare quotes here because this version of the indispensability argument has (more than) one shortcoming, in it leaving unclear what being indispensable to a scientific theory entails. What is it to be dispensable to a theory? To solve this, the modern form of the argument, the \"Enhanced Indispensability Argument\" (EIA), is used instead, which goes as follows:\n\n**** Enhanced Indispensability Argument (EIA)\n\n   P1. We ought to believe in the existence of those entities which are indispensable to our best scientific explanations\n   P2. X is indispensable to our best scientific explanations\n   C. We ought to believe in the existence of X\n\nThe focus has now shifted from indispensability for our best scientific theories to explanations in stead. This move is motivated by two thoughts. For one, it assumes that to succeed as a scientific theory is to offer a good explanation, or at the very least that providing a good explanation is good enough grounds to believe in its existence, provided that being indispensable to our best scientific theories is more than sufficient already. That is, offering good explanations is a necessary condition for being a good theory, as we do not think a theory succeeds without it. It is close to being a sufficient condition for constituting a good scientific theory as well, but I am hesitant to claim so on the grounds that what consitutes a \"good\" explanation is rather contentiuous, as we shall see, and that the number of phenomena a theory can explain does seem to matter as well. I do not believe that an extremely specific theory which somehow makes little to no reference to existing theories and is able to explain a single phenomenon well would count as a succesful one (although it might be argued that calling this an explanation would be questionable, but I digress).\n\nSecond, it carries with it the hope that \"being indispensable to explanation\" is easier to clarify than \"indispensability to a theory.\" This second thought requires one to buy that a) scientific explanation can be satisfactorily defined and delineated from not-\"scientific explanations\", which includes both non-explanations and non-scientific explanations (henceforth with \"explanation\" I will mean \"scientific explanation\" unless otherwise specified). Furthemore, it requires us to find plausible that b) finding that which is indispensable for those explanations is more straightforward than for theories as a whole. I will not grant these moves immediately and will scrutinize them in what's to come.\n\n*** What can the truth or falsity of the EIA possibly lead to\n\nBefore saying why looking at the Putnam-Quine argument could provide us insight on the much more general problem of discretization, let us first evaluate what sort of conclusions we could draw from our investigation. To start, let us say that thoroughly examining the Putnam-Quine argument leads us to consider it a valid form of inference to the actual consituents of the world, and furthermore we find entities or other things for which the argument holds. Our quest would then be complete, as we have found a way to justify dividing up the continuum of space and time (or \"thought space\" in the case of mathematical objects) into discrete, consituent parts (given that the entities which enter in the argument are discrete, which I will argue later they are). This provides a sufficient answer to the \"if at all\" part, and sheds some light on the \"how\" part, though does not exhaust the possibilities. For instance, it would provide little clarity on how, if at all, we do so in ordinary language when talking about footballs and tables, except if we take the EIA to be an exhaustive guide to all actual entities, something which the argument cannot entail in its form stated above.\n\n*** If we were to find that (infinite) idealizations do not factor into the EIA, why is it useful for the main problem of \"discretization\"\n\nAs the reader might have expected, I am not so optimistic about the EIA's chances of meeting the demands to be spelled out. How, then, would investigating it yield us any fruitful information about discretization? For if the EIA does not turn out to be a valid form of inference for determining the discrete parts of reality, it would not rule out the possibility of doing so, much less show us why it is impossible in the first place. In particular, the EIA provides a sufficient condition for something to have ontological status, not a necessary one. Therefore failing to be indispensable to explanation does preclude any entity/structure from having ontological status. (Is this true? Is the EIA not \"those and only those\"?)\nThis concern is real and valid. In fact, finding that the EIA is not valid would not rule out anything about the discretization on its own. Instead, the EIA provides a case study in which to more concretely tackle an instance of this problem, and my hope is that by examing its workings applied to specific examples to be expounded upon below, we might learn something valuable about the more general problem in the process. Given the scope and generality of the issue, it would be extremely optimistic to hope to solve it in a lifetime, much less one thesis, so my aims are more humble: to extract from the EIA some valuable lessons for tackling the discretization problem (or whatever you want to call it.)\n\n*** Why it's worth looking at idealization at the EIA (again)\n\nAs mentioned previously, we seem to have lost the \"how\" in the \"how, if at all\" formulation of the main question in the step of attempting to apply the EIA to idealizations. One argument in favor of this step is that it is a necessary condition for explaining \"how\" something works, /that/ it works at all first. Additionally, the hope is that by showing \"how not\" the EIA, we learn something about \"how not\" to answer the question of discreteness. While the possibilities for discretization are technically endless, humans only need a finite number of counterexamples in order to be dissuaded of the usefulness of something. This rather severe limitation might then be a better starting point: to provide reason for distrusting discretization of continua, rather than providing a direct counterargument. If a direct counterargument comes up, so much the better. If we end up concluding that (infinite) idealizations cannot factor into the EIA, at least we have something.\n\n*** Two ways of evaluating the EIA: P1 and P2\n\nIn order for the EIA to be a sound argument, its premises must entail its conclusion and its premises need to be true. The argumentative structure of the EIA is as straightforward as it gets, so it is valid. The premises, however, are controversial to say the least. Therefore the soundness of the EIA hinges on the acceptance of its premises, meaning that there are two ways the EIA could fail: either it is not true that we ought to believe in those entities that are indispensable to our best scientific explanations, or the relevant entity X is not indispensable for our best scientific theories. Let us say something about each of these in turn.\n\n**** What does arguing against premise 1 give us\n\nRegarding permise 1, arguing against the premise that we ought to believe in those entities that are indispensable for our best scientific theories is arguably the strongest move one could make, as it prevents the argument from taking off at all. Such a line of argument is common among anti-realists.\n\n**** Why not to tackle premise 1\n\nHowever, I would prefer not to take this line of argument for two reasons. For one, I feel it is not so convincing to the putative realist. Many convincing anti-realist arguments have already been made by van Fraassen etc, so I find it unlikely I would be able to sway a realist by making such an argument. Secondly, a succesful argument against premise 1. would take the form of one of the following:\na) argue against explanations, either playing a (crucial) role in forming our explanations or the possibility of explanations in general\nb) argue against indispensability as a criterion for belief in entities\nc) argue against believing in entities, whether some specific entities or entities in general.\n\na) and b) would not entail much at all about the discretization question, while an argument for c) could instead directly be used as an argument for the main problem or again not entail much, as \"we ought not to believe in the existence of entity X\" would simply remove X from the list of things to consider demarcatably, while \"we ought not to beleve in any entity X (which has certain general properties)\" could be reformed as \"we are not able to demarcate discrete objects with property X\", which defeats the point of using the EIA at all.\n\n**** We should look into premise 2 instead\n\n   Therefore, I wish to focus on premise 2: X is indispensable to our best scientific theories. One might immediately object that this is subject to the same charges as before, namely that looking at some class of objects X, say electrons, will likely not entail much about the conclusion in general. The way around this is to pick our X carefully. A candidate could be models in general, as finding out that models are not indispensable would make us not have to believe in them, and if models are analogous to concepts in the sense that they discretize a messy continuum, this might show us something about how this is done in general. However, this is too broad a task, as (almost) all physical explanation concerns models and what consitutes a model is (ironically) difficult to define. This is then subject to the same charge as that for denying explanation outright, or just impossible.\n\n*** Why not use this for premise 1 tho\n\nBut why can we not pick infinite idealizations for conclusion 1 instead, i.e. argue whether or not we ought to believe in the \"existence\" of infinite idealizations if they are necessary for our best scientific explanations, rather than evaluating whether they are in fact dispensable or not? Good question. I believe that arguing against the conditional, be that by denying the consequent or the antecedent, is getting ahead of ourselves. It makes the thing not so useful.\n\n*** TODO MORE TEXT JUSTIFYING WHY IM TACKLING THE EIA ON ITS SECOND PREMISE GOES HERE\n* On explanation\n\nBefore evaluating the indispensablity of certain entities/whatever to the purported explanation of physical phenomena, we need to come to an agreement how, if at all, these explanations explain.\n\nThe stance Shech takes to explanation is a sociological (?) one: explanations are what scientists call explanations. According to Shech, it is not the role of the philosopher to dictate what are good or bad explanations, to say what is good or bad science. \"If one's favorite account of explanation does not account for the standard story [of explaining the FQHE], so much the worse for one's favorite account of explanation\", he says determinately.\n\nI am have two conflicting thoughts on the subject.\n\nOn the one hand, I agree that judging a purported explanation only by reference to \"the\" correct account of explanation is unwise. The decades long debate on explanation has yielded little in the way of consensus about the correct account of explanation, even by the low bar of what is considered consesus in philosophy. Even the deductive nomological account, while seen by many as fatally flawed by not being able to account for the assymetric nature of explanation or being able to distinguish explanatory relevant factors from explanatorily irrelevant ones, is still the most commonl way of explicating explanation, usually prefaced with a half-hearted acknowledgment that is indeed flawed and that these half-hearted apologetics for using it anyway are a cliche in themselves. Other accounts, such as the unificationist account by Kitcher and that other guy, the plethora of causal mechanical models, the interventionist account, mechanistic ones etc, while not enjoying the widespread adoption of the DN model, are still being argued over, with nothing close to a definitive distancing from any of them being the case.\n\nTherefore, arguing the wrongness of an explanation based on it not fitting a certain model of explanation is not particularly convincing for two reasons. One, it requires one to first convince the reader that this account of explanation is the correct one (just trust me), which as seen above, does not seem particularly likely. Secondly, ??\n\nOn the other hand, however, I do not wish to simply do away with any sort of measure of explanatoriness (definitely a word) and to uncritically accept the explanations offered by scientists.\n\nCould lead us to accept bad explanations. Supersymmetry?\n\nHow do we know when the scientific community has accepted something?\n\nTreating the word of scientists as gospel like this does a disservice to them, as it sort of presumes scientists don't and moreover cant set critiria for what is a good explanation.\n\nThis division between philosophy and science seems kind of weird.\n\nWe might be able to identify some common criteria of those things we consider good explanations. For instance, we do not have strongly believe that super symmetry is a good exlpanation for (INSERT WHAT SUPER SYMMETRY EXPLAINS) anymore. Do we believe this simply because physicists have moved on or because there are good reasons for not believing its explanatory capabilities? The latter of course, empirical adequacy is a very important one, which is also a reason we don't consider most of the claims of string theory as explanatory correct.\n\n\nHowever, we must be weary of not simpy defining another concept of explanation. Instead, there are two ways of evaluating the question \"how, if at all, does theory/argument/... X explain phenomenon Y\"?\n\n1. Evaluate whether for every theory of explanation the theory explains. This is the most comprehensive way of tackling the question, and can lead to two answers, only the latter of which is really satisfying\n   a) theory X explains phenomenon Y on accounts of theory of explanation A, B, and C, but not on account of D, E, etc. Therefore, if one believes theories A, B, or C to be the correct theory of explanation, the X explains Y.\n      The problem with this is that either one ends up arguing for the validity of A B or C, which as discussed is dubious or simply leaves it up for the reader to decide for themselves if they believe A B or C, which lacks quite some argumentative force.\n   b) according to all common theories of explanation A, B, ... X does/does not explain Y. Therefore it is plausible to assume X does/does not explain Y, as every theory agrees on the subject.\n   Not only is this quite the amount of work, it is unlikely that we would reach such unanymous agreement, as some theories have widely varying criteria for explanation. Consider for isntance the differnce between causal mechanical and unifying explanations for instance: the former requires an account of how the phenomenon comes to be from the fundamental constituents of the thing and can decide per explanation whether it explains or not, while the latter only requires an explanation to group some set of phenomenon and is not able to say of an individual explanation whether it is \"good\" or not (as most explanations will probably unifity ~some~ phenomena), only whether one explanation is better than another. Comparing the question \"account X constitutes as a good explanation for Y\" (as we are interested in our \"best\" scientific explanations, whatever that may mean) for both the unficationist and the causal mechanical model will therefore prove quite challenging, as a good causal mechanical explanation is just a causal mechanical explanation, while the \"goodness\" of a unificationist explanation is much more graded.\n\n   These are just some of the challenges that come to mind, but again I deem it unlikely unanymous agreement unlikely in the first place, let alone satisfactorily determining whether every explanation is adequate. Does the thermodynamic limit prove a good explanation under all these accounts? Causal mechanical it is certainly doubtful, although some have argued otherwise, see Strevens.\n\n2. Determine some shared criteria all accounts of explanation (should) obey, and evaluate whether these explanations match these criteria.\n\n   This method has two pitfalls\n\n   a) If they obey all of the criteria, this does not mean that it is a successful explanation per se. The criteria only serve a negative purpose, barring would be explanations from attaining such status, as it provides only necessary conditions, no sufficient ones, by design.\n\n   b) Being arbitrarily normative, or rather begging the question\n      If one were to define exclusion criteria for what ought to count as explanation, we need to watch out that we do not beg the question. We must take great care to justify these exclusion criteria, otherwise it can come across as us simply taking elements from these explanations and labeling them as bad. Furthermore the risk exists of excluding an entire category of explanatory theories, which defeats the point.\n\n      (This might happen for instance when one assumes that a good explanation ought to determine which objects in said explanation \"make a difference\", see e.g. cite:DeBianchi2016 )\n\n**** TODO Figure out whether the difference maker discussion excludes the DN model or unificationist model\n*** Goal of the explanation strategy\n\nIn short, the goal in this section is to identify exclusion criteria for explanations that do not\n  a) have arbitrary justification\n  b) exclude an entire theory of explanation\n  c) postulate a new theory of explanation, i.e. be a sufficient condition for explaining.\n     I am not exactly sure what this would look like, but I have one criterion that looks like this\n\n*** Another objection\n\nHow /can/ you identify such criteria? What source of \"explanation\" are you drawing from? The platonic ideal of explanation?\n\nThis is a valid point, but one I can't really answer right now, maybe I'll have a smart reply later.\n\n*** The criteria\n**** TODO A lot. This will form the very foundation of my thesis, while being the most specific part. In order to give a better account here I need to look into the specific phenomena more deeply. What would I gain from that? I feel like I can formulate that to make sense somehow. Self-consistency? Is that different than non-contradiction? It's more of a given,\n**** 1. To warm up, let us begin by defining the most basic criteria any explanation ought to satisfy: it needs to account for the actual empirical thing, save the phenomena as we are fond of saying.\n\n   - Is this part of explanation or of a theory?\n\n**** 2. It needs to follow some sort of \"because\" clause.\n\n   - Very general\n\n**** 3. ...\n**** 4. ...\n**** 5. It needs to create /understanding/ in some agent.\n\n   This might the most crucial one and the most difficult to define. It does hinge on the question: do explanations exist independently of agents to understand them?\n   While this is a difficult question to answer, we need not do so here, provided that it satisfies our earlier defined points, namely is it arbitrary, does it exclude an entire theory of explanation or does it postulate a new one. Let's treat them in turn\n\n***** Arbitrariness\n\n        I'd say no. While not unobjectionable, it certainly does not seem arbitrary or begging the question, as for instance a criterion such as \"no infinities allowed\" would be. Discussion s about udnerstanding and its importance for explanation have been held for a long time in otrher gidelds and have more recently come up in philsophy of science.\n        Moreover it is at least pragmatically true that we would not be aware of any explanations that did not probive any\n\n***** Exclude an entire theory of explanation\n\n        While few of the majors actively include understanding, I argue that none would be significantly changed by including the requirement that they provide understanding.\n\n***** Too sufficient\n\n        This is arguably the biggest charge one could levy against this criterion, since \"providing understanding\" in the sense that someone understands a phenomena after hearing something which does that, sounds like it is explained to them. In order for it not to be sufficient, there need to be things missing from any (set of) proposition(s) which provide understanding, which need to be fulfilled in order to be considered an explanation.\n\n        One thing that comes to mind is that the agent /thinks/ it gained understanding, but in actuality the \"explantion\" which did so is false. Conspiracy theories would constitute such a case: our agent might believe that they gained understanding of the increasing number of autism diagnoses by being \"explained\" that if you get vaccinated then you get autism (or become more likely to get autism) and that the number of vaccinations given has increased. However, the first premise here is false. Has the agent then gained understanding of the increased rate of autism diagnoses? Or more importantly, does the \"explanation\" count as an explanation?\n\n        This would not count as an explanation on all counts of explanation.\n        1. DN: requires all premises to be true. Premise 1 is not true. Therefore not an explanation.\n        2. Causal mechanical: there does not appear that a true causal story of vaccines to autism can be told, therefore not true.\n        3. Interventionist: difficult to tell. While for a single individual it might be possible to intervene here, take an individual without autism and give them a vaccine, see if they develop autism. However few would claim that every single vaccine would cause autism, as most of the world would then be on the spectrum. It seems a lot more difficult to intervene in the course of history and not vaccinate everyone and to then compare whether the autism diagnosis rate remains the same. Counterfactual speculation seems difficult here, therefore it does not appear to be a good explanation.\n        4. Unificationist: as mentioned before, for unificationist accounts, \"good\" is relative. However, since we are interested in what our best scientific explanations are, we can compare this explanation of the increasing vaccine rate with a different one and evaluate which one has the greater unifying power. there's probably one right\n\n    So it might not count as an explanation, mostly on the fact that it is not true or better explanations exist. However, does it count as creating understanding?\n\n****** TODO Evaluate whether this counts as understanding\n\n            - Find definition/theories of understanding\n            - Apply them\n\n**** 6. \"It must match reality in some way\"\n\nThis is definitely begging the question man, we are trying to find this very thing remember? The hell does matching reality mean.\n\n**** 7. The explanation must not create a contradiction\n\nDuh. This seems like to banal to even mention, not sure if I can draw some interesting conclusions out of this.\n\nWhat I'm thinking about is the thermodynamic limit implying the existence of infinity particles, or FQHE implying 2D particles. However, I cannot take this as refuting the fact that they are explanations, as this is exactly the point of contention. Furthermore it's not a flat out paradox, as it is at least logically possible that some particles could be 2D, it is just very plausible /prima facie/.\n\n(Ideally after this section I'd have some kind of idea/criteria for what to look for in a good explanation. My worry is that doing this /before/ looking at the actual examples I either miss things or end up defining criteria based on my discussion of the examples later, which messes up the structure. Therefore I am uncertain of the place of a chapter on explanations in the structure)\n\n* Part II: The phenomena\n** Limit explanation of phase transitions\n\nIn thermodynamics, phase transitions (such as water boiling, a magnet losing its magnetization) are represented by a non-analyticity in the relevant thermodynamic function (such as pressure or magnetization).  The issue is that we do not consider thermodynamics to be the final theory of the world, and in particular do not find it sufficiently explanatory. Moreover, we have a theory we consider to be more \"fundamental\" than thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and would like to account for the phenomenon of phase transitions in said theory.\n\nHowever, the issue arises that the only way in which to directly recapture the thermodynamic phase transitions using statistical mechanical tools is by taking the so called \"thermodynamic limit\", in which the number of particles is taken to infinity while the volume of said particles goes to zero, keeping the density constant. This is because the thermodynaic variables needed for describing the phase transition in statistical mechanics are derived from the partition function, which is a sum of analytic functions. In order for the thermodynamic variables to exhibit a phase transition i.e. a non-analyticity, the partition must contain a singularity. The partition function can only do so if either the energy of the particles is 0, which is impossible, or if the sum is infinite. This latter result is not trivial, nor is it straightforwardly a theorem, but it is commonly accepted as such, see Kadanov.\n\nTherefore, in order to account for (to explain?) the phenomenon of phase transitions, it is claimed, the thermodynamic limit must be taken i.e. we need to make an infinite idealization. Moreover, it cannot easily be explained away by interpreting this \"limiting operation\" as an approximation, i.e. as one of simply seeing the the collection of atoms to be arbitrarily large. One cannot approximate a singularity: it is either there or not there. Therefore, only at N=infinity does the singularity present itself, not at any point beforehand.\n\nHowever, some, like Norton, argue that the singularity is approximated in some sense that is useful, as the curve of the graph gets closer and closer to the one at N=infinity as N->infinity. The important point then is which property we consider.\n\n** Aharanov Bohm effect\n\nSomething about a solenoid in a magnetic field, which needs to be infinite in order for the calculation to make sense. Something something Berry shift.\n\n** FQHE\n\nThe classical hall effect is the phenomenon of measuring a transversal voltage when running a current through the long side of a metal plate, because of Lorentz afguiging. More electrons on the right then on the left, thus potential difference thus voltage.\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect has two sub parts: the integer and fractional quantum hall effect. Let us start with the former. The integer quantum hall effect is observed when running a similar experimental setup to the classical hall effect, but with a much thinner and purer sheet. This gives weird plateaus at integer multiples of the quantum of resitance?. The explanation for these plateaus is some weird stuff about Landau levels, but is ultimately not too surprising.\n\nThe Fractional Quantum hall effect is the weirder one. As the name suggests it is similar in appearance to the integer quantum hall effect, the difference being that the plateaus occur at fractional (1/3 etc) values of the quantum of resistance, rather than at the integer levels. This is rather suprising however, as the explanation for the integer hall effect does not allow there to be fractional quanta. Another explanation, then, is needed. The effect only occurs at even thinner and purer sheets as well. One of the two effects requires a not too pure sheet, cannnot rememver which\n\n\nThe relevant point here is that in order for the explanation of the fractional quantum hall effect (and possibly the integer one as well?) to get of the ground, we /need/ to assume that the configuration space of the electrons in the sheet is two dimensional. For the explanation depends on the fact that the fundamental symmetry group of the particles is Bn, not Sn. Bn is the fundamental group of 2D space, and small 3D space does not equal 2D space. This is an important difference and makes this example much clearer than the Thermodynamic Limit, as this is cool.\n\n** Breaking drops\n\nIn his 2005 paper Breaking Drops something something  cite:Batterman2005 argues that the breaking off of a droplet from a dripping faucet is an example of a genuine discontinuity in nature. While not mentioning the word \"infinite idealization\", it is clear that it was he is implying when making the argument.\n\nThe argument is flawed by using weird conceptions of continuity, in particular by taking the infinite limit before the end of the operation.\n\n* Part III: Discussion(s)\n\n(In this part I want to evaluate what I got out of my discussion of the case studies and generalize from there. These needn't be whole chapters, but it's useful for me to think of them as such for now.

While this might work as a prediction, i.e. if we can figure out the configuration space and then the fundamental group, we might reasonably expect to find particles with such and such quantum statistics there.\n\nHowever, I do not find this very satisfactory as an explanation, it feels much too close to a DN way of explaining things, which, as we know [[file:20210330165632-problems_with_the_dn_model.org][DN cannot determine whether something is a difference maker]]. That is, the explanation works backwards: instead of ending uncontrovertably with the most controversial point, namely that the configuration space of the anyons is 2D, it arrives there kind of casually.\n\n\n\nThe order of explanation as it is usually given is like this:\n1. We have observed fractional quantum statistics (alledgedly, i'm willing to grant that at this point)\n2. /The quantum statistics of the particle are determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space/\n3. The 1D rep of the Braid group is fractional quantum statistics\n4. The Braid group is the first homotopy group of a non-simply connected 2D configuration space\n5. Therefore particles which exhibit fractional quantum statistics need to have a 2D configuration space\n\n\nNow, if all of the above steps /necessarily/ are /if and only ifs/, this argument is rather water tight. However, I would dispute that this is the case here, first and foremost on the grounds that this conclusion is /primae facie/ unacceptable and a paradox, so something seems to go wrong here. We can either resolve this paradox by correcting our physics to allow for precisely 2D configuration spaces, or, what seems more agreeable to me, by not allowing the argument to reach this conclusion, as I do not believe every single on of the steps above are if and only ifs.\n\nSpecifically, I have trouble with step 2, as we appear to need some theorem in order to establish this but I have not really found such a theorem, just vague gestures to the fact that these statistics come from the worldlines being intertwined and whatnot.\n\nThe other way around the explanation looks a lot less secure\n\n1. The configuration space describing the exchange of two identical particles contains a hole in the origin and is thus non-simply connected\n2. Such a space has an infinite number of homotopy classes of equivalent (i.e. continuously deformable into each other) paths\n3. The fundamental group/first homotopy group of these paths is the Braid group\n4. The 1D rep of this group is $e^{i\\theta}$\n5. /This is the spin of the particles we are interested in/\n\n\n** The problem with treating this as a DN explanation\n\nThe problem with treating this a DN explanation is that that requires that the Laws of Nature used are true and ALSO the events described as premises. However, there are not really any of the latter, as we can't take the existence of a 2D things as a premise, as that is weird.\n\n[[file:20210405144616-eia_allows_us_to_verify_dn_premises.org][EIA allows us to verify DN premises]]\n\n\n** COMMENT Brief critique summary\n\n** Leng says: \"Platonism is not real, because we can just say that physical space approximately instantiates mathematical structures, so we don't need that exactness\"\n\n** Shech says: \"We cannot use approximate instantiation if we assume approximation means how Norton says it and if we use the EIA. Then anyons in the FQHE show that something is real but not cannot be approximately instantiated, namely 2D space\".\npp 1977\n\"The fundamental group of approximately 2D is the same as that of 3D, namely $S_n$.\" \"For anyons, we need fundamental group to be $B_n$, and /this can only occur in exactly 2D/.\"\n\"Yet, physical systems are not exactly 2D.\"\n\"Thus, it cannot be said that a physical system 'approximately instantiates' the braid group structure necessary for fractional statistics.\"\n\n# In short: YOU CANNOT HAVE **BRAID GROUP STRUCTURE* IN 3D.\n\n# I say: YES YOU CAN, IF YOU BELIEVE HARD ENOUGH.\n\n** I say:\n\n*** That's not a great argument because the explanation we get from the anyon case/how Shech defines it is not strong enough to factor into the EIA\n\n*** Moreover: This /is/ / can be seen as a case of approximate instantiation!\n\nI aim to show that the Shech's claim that \"it cannot be said that a physical system approximately instantiates the braid group structure\" is false, and we can indeed say that a physical system can approximate such things, just not in the way that Shech thinks about it. The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.\n\nInstead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.\n\nWith \"finding an alternative route\", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.\n1. Bob takes anti-conception pills\n2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant\nC. Bob does not become pregnant.\n\nWhile we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with. This idealization might not be as problematic however. (this is later or earlier, haven't figured out where to put it)\n\n=garbo=\nNext, we have an equally unpromising candidate, which is the \"mini-explanation\". The fundamental group of 2D exchange under two particles is the Braid group\nE. The fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of $N$ identical particles in 2D is $B_N$\nL. The quantum statistics of a particle is the 1D rep of the fundamental group of the ...\nC. The quantum statistics of 2D particles are anyonic i.e. $e^{i\\theta}$\n(I'm being loose with the structure here, as otherwise it would be a huge drag to write everything out, i.e. \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of two identical particles is $e^{i\\theta}$\", \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group ... are the quantum statistics\", .... (secretly I don't really know how to write this out DN style as the example laws are always extremely simple conditionals, nor do I really know how to transfer this to theorems rather than laws. If this is a big problem we can discuss this, I think more likely I will have to get rid of the reference to the DN explanation or formulate this differently entirely. Regardless, this is more an example of how I wish to argue))\n=garbo=\n\n...\n\nThe most promising candidate for such an intervention is centered around the fundamental group of the system, but not in the way that the argument is presented by Shech. Instead let us examine how the argument goes once more:\n\nWe see the Quantum Hall Effect manifest\n\n** COMMENT Checklist\n\n To show it can be approximated, I need to show that there are /some/ paths which are nondeformable into one another/non collapsible to a point. In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*\n\n** Options\n\n*** Particles have nonzero size\n\nIn these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.\n\n*** Not ALL paths\n\nWhile the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.\n\n\n*** Winding can be something different?\nThe main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210403175539-group.org][Group]]\n\n\n\n\n** COMMENT Junk\n\n Startingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.\n\n However, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one. While I agree the 3D space cannot approximate 2D space if the property under consideration is connectedness as presented, I do think it is possible for some other factor down the argumentative line to be considered \"approximately instantiated\" in the Nortonian sense.\n\n We just need to find a different path to \"fit in\" to the explanation of the possibility of anyons, i.e. either\n 1. 2D space is approximately instatiated in the experiment due to thinness and strong fields, giving rise to something with the same properties as 2D space\n 2. Holes are approximately instantiated, for instance ??\n 3. Connectedness is approximate, in the sense that we don't care about /all/ paths but just most paths, and we can create a lot of paths which don't work well\n 4. Homotopy classes are approximate, in the sense that we don't derive the homotopy classes from the connectedness of the space but from looking at different paths and seeing that they /don't/ act the same way. rather than that they /can't/ act the same way\n 5.

This phase is obtained when a state is transported along parameter space from its starting position and back again, completing a loop.\n\n* The importance of the adiabatic theorem\n\n  The adiabatic theorem seems to be important for the computation of the Berry phase, serving a similar role as \"parallel\" in [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]: by keeping the system in the same phase, we can reasonably talk about its phase difference and discard the phase evolution. But, this only happens in the limit of the state being transformed infinitely slowly.\n\n  =Luckily, this limit is smoothly approached, just as it is for parallel transport: if we don't keep the vector /precisely/ parallel but only approximatley, we still get some angle difference despite us not being perfect.=\n\n\n* Berry phase calculation in 2D\n\n  Here we calculate the Berry phase over the Berry Connection\n\n  ...\n=ADD EXPLANATION THAT SHOWS THIS=\n\n\n  We see that we still get a discontinuous jump at $k=2\\pi$ when the loop comes back around, which does not seem like an improvement from our topological example, the only thing we have changed is instead of talking about topology we talk about geometry.\n\n  However, this is in fact quite the improvement, because geometry can be somewhat more easily be changed than topology (cutting a hole in a space is more difficult than making it a bit smoother). We will look at an example\n\n* The Cone Example and Holonomy\n\n  The initial way of calculating the Berry phase shows that we still get a discontinuous jump, which is bad. Here we will see that sometimes this can be removed, by looking at the parallel transport of a vector around a cone.\n\n  Parallel transport is a bit strange. On a flat Euclidean plane, nothing happens.\n  A cone is like a flat Euclidean plane glued together in a weird way, like this\n\n[[./media/conefold.png]]\n\nWhere side $s$ is glued to side $?$ in order to yield a smooth surface, with the exception of the problematic point $S$.\n\nWe can then calculate our parallel transport by simply \"doing\" the parallel transport on the surface of the \"flat\" cone.\n\nThe vector is transport from the one side to the other, eventually reaching the edge $s$, from where it is suddenly teleported to $s$, ending up with a much different angle.\n\n[[./media/transport.jpeg]]\nhttps://www.physicsforums.com/threads/parallel-transport-and-cone.1000209/\n\n\nThis angle difference is directly related to the angle of the cone. We see that the sharper the cone, the bigger the failure of parallel transport (holonomy) will be.\n\nThe strange thing is, of course, that this angle difference appears rather suddenly only after we completed >1 round. However, were we to move an 'actual' vector on a cone, we'd expect this to happen slowly, right? We want to get rid of the \"discontinuous jump\".\n\nThis question proves rather difficult to answer, for two reasons.\n1. The holonomic angle is only defined when the vector returns to its original position, we don't expect thing to be the same when we simply stop the transport somewhere in the middle.\n2. Actual cones are not this pointy.\n\nhttp://applet-magic.com/paralleltransport.htm\n\nIn actuality, when you deform the cone in the figure above, the angle /does/ change continuously along the path of the cone wrt beginning angle, but that's very often the case and does not count.\n\nInstead of having the continuous parameter be the angle of the cone, a better one would be the \"path\", since we are interested in paths after all. Here we see that if we take any path that does not cross the \"seam\", the angle remains 0. But the seam is kind of arbitrary, so that is not really fair.\nWe do know, however, that if the path encircles the tip of the cone it definitely passes the seam. So now we have our discontinuity: all paths that do not cross the tip do not gain a holomorphic angle (because those paths are the same as paths in Euclidean spacetime), while as soon as the path encompasses the origin it has to cross the seam and thus gains an angle $\\phi$.\n\nSince this failure of parallel transport is a geometric property, we say that all the geometric information of the cone is centered in one point, because inclusion of that point in the path makes or breaks the angle.\n\n** Less pointy cone\n\n\n   As we see, the thing we then need to change in order to get a more smooth cone holonomy is the tip. At the moment we have only one point which is problematic. This can be seen as our idealization: an infinitely sharp cone instead of a blunt one.\n\n   When we blunt the cone, we suddenly see that the path can be continuously deformed to include the \"seam\". However, what we have gained in smoothness we have lost in mathematical simplicity: we no longer can easily relate the cone to the Euclidean plane. In order to describe the blunt cone, we need to describe it's /connection/ and do some differential geometry.\n\n   ...\n\n   Now we see that the cone is good.\n\n* Relating this back to anyons\n\n  The case with anyons is similar: we calculate the geometric phase using the fact that the space has one anomolous point, namely the spot where the other particle is.

However, many things are postulated in physics and never realized, so just being an idealization does not make it intersitng.\n   However, anyons are claimed to be observed [@Bartolomei2020]. How then do we square this?\n\n\nSome, like [@Shech2019], go even further and claim that these kinds of observations give indirect evidence for Platonism, making anyons even more intersting to look at.\n\nThe standard explanation of anyons is inherently /topological/. Topological explanation share something inherently in common with idealizations, and are thus extra worth looking at.\n\nWe can't directly talk about the failure of any particular idealization, only about a certain property. Anyons are interesting because the property is existence.\n\n\nHowever, to properly understand anyons, we need to look at the actual systems from which they come, which are things that look like the quantum hall effect. Otherwise we are simply examining the idealization on its own, rather than seeing whether the idealization corresponds to reality in any way (super-symmetry etc). Therefore, we should look at the FQHE to properly evaluate the status of anyons.\n\nFrom examining this, we see that the phase does not arise topologically in the description of the quantum hall effect (as you cannot really calculate things with that) but /geometrically/. Thus we will need to examine how geometric phase works and whether and how this could be related to the topology.\n\nThis discussion will then offer some inspiration for how such topological questions should be thought of.\n- Topological explanations are not uncommon in physics, example?.\n\n** New intro\n\n=Good line to introduce the chapter=\n\n\nThe main subject of discussion here will be a new class of (quasi-)particles: anyons. In undergraduate courses, or, if you're lucky, highschool, we learn that two types of particles exist: fermions and bosons. These particles are distinguished by spin, half-integer and integer spin respectively. Anyons, as their name suggests, break this binary and are allowed /any/ type of spin, creating a whole new category of particle.[fn:4] While anyons are fascinating in their own right, we are interested in them because, according to the canon explanation, anyons are two-dimensional particles. More suggestively, the space they occupy cannot be /approximately/ $2D$, such as a $3D$ space of $1nm$ height, but /exactly/ two dimensional: a clear case of an infinite(simal) idealization. Of course, anyons would be just another plaything, were it not that, at the time of writing, anyons have rather strong empirical backing [@Bartolomei2020].\n\n\nAnother reason why anyons present such an interesting case, is that their explanation explicitly requires /topological/ arguments. Topological arguments, as I will show, show up in unexpected places and allow problematic idealizations to sneak in, as they smooth out many of the difficult to solve geometry. By tackling such an explicit use of topology in an infinite idealization, we will be able to use the argumentative structure in our general analysis of infinite idealizations. =The opposite of topology is geometry=\n\n*************** TODO this is a new task tallyho\n*************** END\n\n\n[fn:4] Or an infinite number of new particle types, depending on one's preference.\n\n\n\n* Topology and Anyons\n\nIn a standard physics undergraduate program, you learn that there are two types of particles, fermions and bosons, which are distinguished by their spin, fermions coming in half-integer multiples $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} , ... )$ and bosons in integer multiples $(0, 1, 2, ...)$. A good starting question for understanding anyons would be: why /do/ we think there are only two types of particles? Why not $1$, or $3$, or infintely many? While many similar questions are as of yet unanswerable, such as why there appear to be only three generations of leptons (e.g. electrons, muons, tauons) or three fundamental forces in the standard model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), this one does have an accepted answer. It is, as always, a combination of experimental results and theory. Fermions and bosons' share few features besides the fact that they are particles, but the important commonality is that they are both /indistinguishable/ particles. Every electron is the exact same as every other electron, and every photon is perfectly identical to the next. There is no way to tell whether two fermions or two bosons have switched places when you weren't looking. We will explore the consequences of this in more detail later, but the important consequence of this fact is that it induces an overdescription of the physical situation: we can mathematically describe two situations, one in which we have electron $1$ on the left and electron $2$ on the left. While mathematically distinct, these situations are physically identical, and in order for our physics to make sense we need to account for this distinction. The reasons for assuming indistinguishability could be a thesis topic in its own right, and the above description does not attempt to do it justice. The important point is /how/ we arrive from this indistinguishability to the fact that there are two types of particles: how does indistinguishability help us distinguish particles, and how do we mathematically distinguish these identical states?\n\nAs a warm-up, let us consider a rather handwavey argument. Handwavey, because it relies on the particles still being distinguishable, but it illustrates the point. Say we start with a system $\\Psi_0$ of two particles, $x_1$ and $x_2$, each with their own probability distribution $\\psi_i$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)\\]\nNow, for our next trick, we will exchange the two particles, such that particle $x_1$ is in state $\\psi_a$ and particle $x_2$ is in state $\\psi_b$. If we suggestively take state $\\psi_i$ to be mean something like \"having probability $1$ of being found around $x=a$\", then this exchange can be the physical exchange of the two particles. Now, of course, we do not know which particle is which, so writing down the 1-exchange wave function would be getting ahead of ourselves, but we do know that if we were to exchange the particles once again we should regain our initial wavefunction $\\Psi_0$. To dentote this, we define an exchange operator $P$ which does just, and say that the wavefunction after exchanging twice (= rotating by 360 degrees) is $\\psi_{2\\pi}=P^2\\psi_0=1\\psi_0$. To find the wavefunction of the 1-exchang system, we find\n\\[\\psi_{\\pi}=P\\psi_0=\\sqrt{1}\\psi_0=\\pm 1\\psi_0\\]\n\nThis yields two possibilities for particles: those for with $P=-1$ and those for which $P=1$. The latter are bosons and the former are fermions.[fn:7]\n\n\n\n\nThe above argument is too handwavey, so we would like to make it more concrete. The way to define what we mean by \"exchange/ability/\". To start, the suggestively italicized /ability/ part of exchangeability hints at the fact that the /possible/ ways a particle /is able to be/ exchanged is of central importance. One natural way of defining this is by looking at all the possible paths the particle can take. We would need to look at the /configuration space/ of the particles: the possible configurations of them and connections between these configurations.[fn:8] Now we need to supplant this with a notion of what it means for two paths to be /the same/, or, equivalently, what it means for two paths to be different. This idea of path-similarity depends on which factors we judge relevant when considering manipulating quantum particles, which we need to choose if we wish to obtain the most general description possible. Like most of physics, we would not want our description to depend on some sort of absolute position or orientation in space, so our description better ignore those. Beyond that, however, identifying the relevant factors of the space becomes more tricky. The two most promising candidates are a /geometric/ or /topological/ notion of path similarity. As it turns out, the latter is used in the most commonly accepted explanation of anyons, the main reason being the mathematical and conceptual simplicity it brings.\n\nThe main notion of similarity used to explain anyons, namely the topological notion of /homotopy equivalence/, roughly means that two paths are the same if they can be continuously deformed into one another. This differs wildly from /geometric/ path equivalence: there paths are only \"the same\" if they traverse the same path in the same space, they need to be =isomorphic=. Consider the difference between a mountain ridge versus a nice meadow. Geometrically, the two are very different, and if we were to care about how exhausting a hike over that distance would be we would certainly not neglect to take those differences into consideration. On the other hand, if we were an amateur nautical cartographer interested in plotting out all bodies of water in the area, we would consider both spaces identically topologically: neither of them has any lakes. It is clear why a topological approach to particle paths would be attractive, as it massively simplifies the set of possibilities down to the bare essentials. It is clear that sometimes we do need to consider the relevant geometry however: our hiker will no doubt complain if their map-making friend confuses meadows for mountains, or vice versa depending on their constitution.\n\nReturning to anyons, we see that the approach taken for the /explanation/ turns out to be topological, while when actually calculating the phase we need to take into account the /geometry/. Here we will first discuss the topological argument, after which we will consider the prequisites for and the geometrical argument itself in Section 3 and 4.\n\nBy focussing on the homotopy notion of equivalent paths, we release ourselves from the burden of having to examine each individual path and instead are able to focus on features of the /space/. Specifically, since we only need whether two paths are continuously deformed into one another, we just need to look at whether the space allows for such trickyness. This feature of a space is called its *connectedness*. A space is called *simply connected* iff all /loops/ can be deformed into a point, like in figure ref:fig:connectedness. For our purposes, since we are looking at the position of a particle in spacetime, we can consider a space to be simply connected if it has no holes. Here a hole is a hole that \"pierces\" the space: the handle in the \"space\" of a coffeecup and the hole in the \"space\" of a donut are prime examples, while the inside of a bottle or a bubble in a glass of coke do not count as \"holes\" for the sake of connectedness. On the contrary, spaces with such holes are called /multiply-connected/, or sometimes more simply /non-simply-connected/ spaces.\n\nThis concept of connectedness allows us to understand the main assumption behind the handwavey argument above: we return to the same position after rotating 2\\pi if the space is simply connected, because \"being the same\" means \"being the same path\" and \"being the same path\" means \"being able to continuously deform them to each other\" and \"doing nothing\" is the \"point path\" and you are only able to shrink all paths to a point in a simply connected space. This, of course, raises the question: is the configuration space of two identical particles always simply connected, i.e., why do should we return to the same system after rotating $2\\pi$? As we will see, it is simply connected in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but /not/ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is why people say that anyons can only exist in 2D. As we will also see, however, is that this is not strictly true, as we can conceive of somewhat plausible multiply-connected 3D spaces.\n\n[fn:7] Note that this does not directly follow: it could also be the case that particles just sometimes have -1 and other times +1. Empirically, however, we find no such distinction, only dependent on particle type.\n\n[fn:8] The other framework for considering such exchange is in terms of exchanging all the relevant quantum numbers, effectively mathematically swapping the particles. We shall see that this does not work for defining anyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Phase\n\nMuch of the upcoming section will be centered around calculating the /phase/ of a quantum system, and it will be useful to briefly go over what we mean by phase and its relation to anyons. Briefly stated, the phase factor is a complex number which does not change the physical information if applied globally, that is when multiplying every wavefunction under consideration with it. The $\\pm1$ applied by our operator $P$ is such a phase.\nPhase arises because the empirical outcome of measuring a quantum state involves calculating the modulo-squared of the wavefunction. There are simply (at least) two wavefunctions which arrive at the same outcome if you square them with their complex conjugate: - that wavefunction and plus that wavefunction. They are both perfectly fine mathematical representations of the same state, just like the fact that the square root of 9 can be both -3 and 3. When asked: what is the length of the side of a square field of 9 square meters, the answer is indeterminate: it can be either 3 or -3. Rather than saying it can only be positive, we can be a bit more general and say that the \"phase factor\" in front of the three is unphysical: it simply does not matter for calculating the surface area of the field what  it is. We have, of course, some empirical preference for using positive lengths in stead of negative ones, but we do not such physical intuitions for wave functions, as they live in Hilbert Space and we unfortunately only have 4D spacetime to our disposal. Since wavefunctions live in /complex/ Hilbert space, the most general factor that would get $||^2$ away is not $\\pm 1$, but $e^{i\\theta}$, as that simply /is/ the square root of $1$ in $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus any wavefunction will show empirical differences when multiplied with $e^{i\\theta}\\quad\\forall\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\nIt is of course not immediately clear what this has to do with paths in configuration space or anyons for that fact. The answer is that, while systems could theoretically obtain any phase, they do not in general do so. We know from examining the time-dependent Schrodinger equation that it can be reduced to the time-/independent/ schrodinger equation times a phase factor, which depends on time and the energy of the system. However, while we said that phase does not matter physically, this is only the case for the system as a whole: if two systems have different phase they interfere. It's analogous measuring any other kind of wave: you will have to pick a starting point in order to describe the offset of a particular wave. These phases don't matter until you measure two waves interfering, which leads to inteference. For particles this leads to destructive interference for fermions: if the exact same wave would =xxxxxxxxxx= then there is probability zero of it being there. This is the Pauli-exclusion principle.\n\nThus while phases do not appear to matter /prima faciae/, they are the reason matter is able to exist in the first place! Without the Pauli Exclusion Principle it would not be possible for matter to clump together, as everything would simply phase through each other (barring electromagnetic interactions).\n\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]] :level 2\n\n\n** The configuration space explanation for anyons\n\nThe topological explanation gestured at above consists of roughly the following steps:\n1. Construct the /configuration space/ of the system, that is, all possible positions our particle pair could be in.\n2. Find all possible homotopy equivalent paths, and, by extension, the /fundamental group/ of the space.\n3. Derive the 1D-representation of that group, that is, a scalar representing that group. This is the phase-factor.\n\nWe will go through these steps in detail for the case of anyons and other particles. After showing that anyons appear to only be possible in 2D, we construct a toy 3D-configuration space in which anyons are also possible.\n\n\n*** The 3D case\n**** Constructing the configuration space\nOur first task is to construct the configuration space for the exchange of $N$ identical particles in $3D$, after which we will examine its topological properties. The most general configuration space we can construct is one for $N$ particles living in $d$ dimensions, which would be\n \n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbb{R}^d_1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_2 ... \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_N\n    \\label{eq:Ndconfig}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (1)$$\n\nWe shall for now focus on just two particles in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which would be the configuration space occupied by two $3$-dimensional vectors $(r_1, r_2)$ representing two particles\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3  \\]\nAs we are dealing with identical particles, however, we need to add some extra structure, which results in our configuration space being much smaller than the above.\n\nTo simplify our notation and avoid having to conceptualize $9$-dimensional space, we can define our configuration space in terms of the center of mass of the particles $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1+r_2})}{2}$ and their difference vector $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r_1-r_2}$. Clearly the configuration space of $(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r})$ is still $\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. However, now we can pull a trick. We only care about exchanging the particles, right? It seems reasonable, therefore, that the position of the system as a whole does not play in a role in determining all possible positions of the particle, e.g. it should not matter (we assume, quite reasonably) whether we exchange two fermions in our lab on Earth or on Venus. For our purposes, then, we can safely ignore one of the two $\\mathbb{R}^3$s and simply focus on the relative distance and orientation of the two particles with each other.[fn:9] This simplifies the problem of finding the configuration space significantly.\n\nLet us return to the constraints. The first constraint is the indistinguishability of the particles. Since it is impossible to distinguish the situation $(r_1,r_2)$ from $(r_2,r_1)$, we cannot take these two configurations to be separate points in configuration space and must remove them. We can represent this by \"dividing out\" the permutation group $S_2$ from our current configuration space,[fn:10] yielding\n\\[\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^3 }{S_2}\\]\n\nThe second and final constraint is accounting for particles not being able to intersect with each other. The argument for /why/ we ought to, however, is rarely made precise. The general tendency, as by\n\n#+transclude: [[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n[fn:9] Another way of thinking about this is to consider one particle to be fixed and the other moving around it.\n\n[fn:10] This makes it somewhat difficult to visually relate the \"one particle standing still\" picture to what the configuration space actually represents. Roughly, you can imagine it as the \"moving\" particle returning back to its original position after a rotation of $\\pi$ radians.\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect\n\nSo, anyons are claimed to be observed in 2D only.\nHowever, some claim that anyons are observed [@Bartolomei2020]  in actual systems. Does this mean that those systems are /actually/ two dimensional? This would go against much of our general intuition about systems.\n- Physisists claim that these systems are /approximatley/ or /effectively/ 2D (=sources=).\n- Following [@Norton2012], we know how to interpret this: we can demote an idealization to an approximation if we are able to show that there is a smooth limit.\n- This is exactly the problem, according to [@Shech2019]: the topological explanation of anyons requires an /exact/ 2D system (or a rather ad-hoc 2D system as we saw).\n- Therefore we cannot call this approximately 2D.\n- According to [@Shech2019], this is a problem for those with nominalist inclinations[fn:1], as the instantiation of abstract mathematical structures in the real world would be an issue.\n  - Such an argument can only be made, however, through the use of the EIA which was discussed in the previous (or next?) chapter.\n- Therefore, it would do such people well to examine the physical effect thoroughly for any signs of this.\n\n\n\nLuckily, hope is on the horizon: it turns out that the computations of the phase of the alledged anyons in the FQHE uses a geometrical notion rather than a topological notion of phase.\n- Unluckily, this geometrical notion also relies on a two dimensional idealization.\n- However, this idealization /could/ conceivably be demoted to an approximation.\n\nIn this chapter, we will examine the inner working of the Quantum Hall Effect. This is needed in order to understand the following\n1. Why do people say that these particles are anyons\n2. What idealizations are made in the explanation of the quantum hall effect separate from the topological one.\n3. ...\n\nReaders less interested in the details can skip to the last subsection of this section =link= and the next section =link=.\n\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect is the quantum version of the classical hall effect, a rather straightforward consequence of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. It was discovered all the way back in =XXXX= by Edwin Hall, who claimed it a novelty which would never have any use-case. Today Hall-Effect sensors are widely used to pick up magnetic fields and rotations of conducting materials. More esoteric applications are as potential long-term space-travel propellants in so-called Hall-Effect thrusters, which are a specific form of ion propolsion, which can generate a low thrust for a very long amount of time.\n\nThe basics of the effect are rather simple\n- Strip which has current flowing through it.\n- Magnetic field perpendicular to that strip\n- Induces Lorentz force which pushes particles to one side, increasing their concentration and creating a potential difference, inducing a voltage changing the resistivity.\n- This resistivity linearly depends on the voltage, which linearly depends on the concentration difference which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field, thus yielding a linear dependence of the resistivity to the strenght of the perpendicular magnetic field.\n- Looks like figure ref:fig:che\n\nHowever, as most classical effects, they only hold in a certain regime. When we clean up the materials, lower the temperature dramatically (<2K) and increase the magnetic field strength considerably, we observe the /Quantum Hall Effect/ (QHE): rather than a linear dependence on the magnetic field strength, the resistivity shows these strange plateaux at rather consistent values, as in ref:fig:qhe. The spacing between these plateaux does not seem to differ between different materials, which is even more curious.\n\nSo: why? Why do we see these plateaux, and why at these levels? The short answer (partially) is: the impurities in the sample lift the degeneracy of the eigenstates of the Quantum Hall system, called Landau levels, and /localizes/ some of those states, rather than the states extending from one edge of the sample to the other (akin to the wavefunctions of a particle in a box). These localized states do not conduct current (as do not span the system, and resistivity is measured from end to end), thus leading to the plateaux in the resistivity: we change plateaux when all the localized states are filled and we move to different extended states. The specific values of these levels depend on weird physics at the boundaries of the system called /edge-modes/, but in short the levels correspond to the number of filled Landau levels: at higher magnetic field strengths the levels can accommodate more states, thus the lower the magnetic field strength the larger the number of available levels, leading to a smooth-looking linear dependence in the classical regime.\n\nThere are quite some caveats to the above story, but that is the gist of why the effect happens for /integer levels/. The less interested reader can skip over the following section describing the corresponding /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/ (IQHE) and head to the description of its fractional cousin, where the same does not hold. Specifically, the IQHE requires one massive idealization: electron interaction is neglected completely. As we shall see, this idealization cannot hold in the FQHE.\n\n[fn:1] If the reader was not aware of this yet, the author does hold such inclinations.\n\n** The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\nIn order to do as little physics as is possibly required, I will skip most of the justification for the quantum formalism of the QHE (quantizing the classical Hamiltonian, finding the commutators) and many of the intermediate steps to arrive at the relevant results. I point the interested reader to [@Tong2016][[]] for a quite accessible and to [@Arovas2020] for a more thorough pedagogical discussion of these issues, and to [@Stone1992; @Prange1987; @Doucot2005] for rather complete, less pedagogical sources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) is the observation of plateaux in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ at regular intervals. These intervals happen to be integer multiples of the /quantum of resistance/  $R_q=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2}$. =check whether this is so=\n- This is rather curious, why so precise?\n- In fact, so precise that these experiments are used to determine the quantum of resistance.\n- Why are they there, and why at those levels?\n\nAs physicists, the first thought as to the origin of these plateaux probably goes to the energy eigenstates of the system, which turns out to be correct! The plateaux correspond to the general energy eigenstates of a system of charged particles moving in a perpendicular magnetic field, so called Landau levels.\n- It will be difficult to properly understand the QHE without first briefly going over landau levels.\n\n=Assumptions=\n\n*** Landau Levels\n\nHere we already start to sneak in our idealizations: we will treat this system as if it is two dimensional. =However, this system can be easily extended to 3D, see XXXX=\n\nThe simplest Hamiltonian for a system of particles moving in a magnetic field is\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2} m(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} +e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} )^2\n    \\label{eq:landauham}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (2)$$\n\nThe  magnetic field is perpendicular to the $x,y$-plane, so we define the vector potential $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}$ using our knowledge that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane $\\nabla\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=B \\hat{z}$, to be\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\nxB\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n    \\label{eq:landaugauge}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (3)$$\n\n=This will be appendix=\nThe easiest way to find the energy eigenstates is the way all Hamiltonians get solved: treat is as the harmonic oscillator. As the Hamiltonian of the \"normal\" harmonic oscillator is\n\n\n..\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x - i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for $\\pi$ then tell us that $a$ and $a^\\dagger$ obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n\\[H= \\frac{1}{2}m \\pi^2   = \\omega_B \\left( a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2}  \\right)\\]\nWe find that the energy eigenlevels are\n\\[\\ket{n}=\\omega_B\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\n*** Calculating the degeneracy\n\nWe started by saying that the plateaux in the IQHE correspond to the various filled Landau levels of the simple particle in a magnetic field system. We still need to prove this, namely by deriving the conductivity for the Hall states. This can get rather messy, so I will show put the derivation for a single particle here, and the more general derivation of the so called /Kubo formula/ in the Appendix.\n\n=sloppy=\n\nTo find the resistivity, we use Ohm's law, which relates the energy of a particle to the current density (current over area)\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{E}=\\sigma \\mathbf{J}\n    \\label{eq:ohm}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (4)$$\n\nOur mechanical momentum is\n\\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} = m \\hat{\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}}\\]\nClassically, the current (for a single particle) is simply $\\mathbf{I}=-e\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}$, but isnce we are working quantum mechanically we take the expectation value\n\n\\[I=-e/m \\sum_filled_states \\bra{\\psi}-i\\hbar\\nabla+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\ket{\\psi} \\]\n\nWe are working in Landau gauge.\n\n...\n\nWe end up with\n*** Edge modes\n\nIn order to provide a more thorough calculation (i.e. not just considering a single electron) we take advantage of a the fact that the system is bounded. I will not reproduce this here.\n\n\n*** Robutsness\n\nThe explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\nThis is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness.\n\nExperimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Figure 1: <<fig:disorder>>Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:disorder\n[[file:./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n#+caption: Figure 2: <<fig:extended>>Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:extended\n[[file:./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (5)$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    | \\Delta V | <<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} |\n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (6)$$\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.=\n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=.\n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see [@Tong2016]\n\n\nThat is it for the IQHE, as we derived the two things we needed from it: we gained a general understanding of why the plateaux have their values (they are the energy eigenvalues of the Landau levels) and, more importantly, we roughly understand why these plateaux are robust.\nUnfortunately, this is not the end of the story, we did not even mention anything topological yet! For that we finally turn to the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.\n\n[fn:5] Improved performance of impure 2D materials is an active area of research in material science, see [@Wang2020] for a summary of how impurities enhance the conductivity of graphene.\n\n[fn:6] The non-dirty sample just discussed is a great example of taking an idealization too seriously: we cannot explain the phenomena in the idealized setting, and have to retrofit extra physics on top of the idealization in order to get a satisfying explanation, only for us to then show in the limit of no impurities we regain our initial idealization. If this limit would not have been smooth (it fortunately is), we would have wasted all this time!\n\n\n** The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nFollowing the naming convention of the IQHE, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) refers to the observation of plateaux at /fractional/ values of the quantum of resistance in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$. Sadly, very few of the arguments mentioned above will be able to explain these plateaux, as we have only shown that they appear at fully filled Landau levels. However, our intuition about the robustness will still hold.\n\n\nThe goal of this expos\\'e is twofold. First we want to gain a general understanding of how the FQHE is thought about in general: what assumptions go into calculating the relevant parameters, which idealizations are noteworthy, etc. The other main goal is the 'derivation' of the Laughlin wavefunction, the wavefunction used to describe the FQH system, and its excitations. At the end we will arrive at the problem of calculating the exchange statistics of these excitations, which turn out to be /anyons/, but not actually compute them yet: this will be done in section ref:sec:GeometricPhase.\n\n\nThe key difference between the description of the Fractional as opposed to the Integer Quantum Hall effect is the inclusion of electron interactions in the former, which becomes impossible to ignore at the energy scales above $\\nu=1$, which is where most of the FQHE physics is done. As a result the reasoning cannot be as rigorous as before. In the IQHE we could pretend that all the states occupied the same Landau level, which allowed us to calculate the wavefunctions and energy levels, leading to the derivation of the Hall resistivity and confirm our suspicion that the plateaux correspond to fully filled Landau levels. Only after doing that did we let go of that idealization and allow the degeneracy to be lifted in order to argue that the plateaux were robust.\n\nThis order of operation is no longer possible in the FQHE, as the electron interactions lift the degeneracy of the Landau levels from the start, forcing us to compute the wavefunctions in a different way. A first approach would be to use perturbation theory: model the electron interaction as a small perturbation to ref:eq:landauham and then gradually compute a better and better approximation to the actual wavefunction. While this is fine for simple two-electron systems, the number of electrons in a QH system is closer to $10^{23}$. That is a rather large matrix to diagonalize, not even close to possible to do numerically. Therefore, we need to pull some tricks.\n\nThe trick is: do not compute the wave function, just write one down. That is exactly what [@Laughlin1983] did, yielding what we now call the *Laughlin wavefunction*\n\n[[file:20210311182300-the_laughlin_wavefunction.org][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]\n\nLaughlin of course did not just simply write down a bunch of wavefunction and pick the one he liked best, it is motivated by some observations from the system and from some general conditions we have to place on any wavefunction. Specifically, in a previous paper [@Laughlin1983a] he derived the wavefunctions for three particles in the FQHE. Recapping this in the case of two electrons is worthwhile.\n\nWe have a system of two electrons with a potential $V(|r_1-r_2|)$.\n- To solve such systems, it's easiest to work with angular momentum.\n- If we want to work with angular momentum, the gauge we picked before (Landau Gauge) is not very useful, as it does not include any kind of rotation\n  - Instead we pick /symmetric gauge/, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\times \\mathbf{B}= -yB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + xB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n- Skipping multiple steps ahead, we see that the wavefunctions look like\n\nUnfortunately this does not uniquely or straightforwardly generalize to N particles, so we have to pull a few more tricks.\n1. We do try to generalize, and say that a wavefunction for N particles will look something like $f(z)e^{something}$\n2. We /insist/ that the wavefunction be in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) it can possibly be: there are no other Landau levels it can fall back on. This is rather strong. This leads to the claim that $f(z)$ /must/ be analytic. =how=\n3. Since the state will have to describe fermions, the wave function must be anti-symmetric under exchange of the particles, which requires $f(z)$ to be odd.\n4. Finally, since we need to conserve angular momentum, we require that =f(z) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree M, where M is the total angular momentum.=\n\nAll these constraints add up to the fact that $f(z)=\\prod_{j<k}(z_j-z_k)^m$, with $m$ odd.\n*This is what people mean when they say that the LWF falls into the same universality class as the actual wavefunction, as any wavefunction needs to account for this.[fn:3]*\n\nWell, neat, you might say, but this still just describes fermions, I thought we were going to be talking about anyons! Right you are, things only really get exciting once we start talking about /excitations/ of this ground state.\n\n- The excitations of the FQH state (technically of the state described by the Laughlin wavefunction, which are not exactly alike)\n\n[fn:3] The LWF might appear to just be an easy to compute with exemplar of this universality class, but it actually has some other nice features which set it apart from its siblings, see =other nice feature of LWF=\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Phase\n\n* Unresolved Issues\n\n** What is the importance of the 2D idealization for the FQHE\nThe quantum hall effect has also been studied in three dimensions, see [@Torres2020; @Tang2019; @Pavlosiuk2017].\n\nApparently it is not as straightforward as I thought, people have constructed the 3D fractional quantum hall effect, but it's rather difficult.\n\nThe difference-maker for whether an electron gas is 2D seems to be it's Fermi-surface topology.\n[[file:20210601145016-3d_quantum_hall_effect.org][3D Quantum Hall Effect]]\n* Citations I still need to use\n\n[@Shech2015b]\n\n[@Wilczek1982]\n\n[@Rao2001]\n\n[@Knapp2016]\n\n\\printbibliography\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1}],"additions":135,"deletions":15},{"oid":"5f8f2c69a512a20f7ecccd7644c9b824f106ecbe","message":"Scripted auto-commit on change (2021-07-01 19:51:47) by gitwatch.sh\n","date":1625161907,"files":[{"filepath":"20210511111209-holonomy_arises_through_the_curvature_of_parameter_space.org","oid":"edd17ce023e12e3203507b3f077c43c4128fe684","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       81bc17b9-b374-464e-a3fe-16291a49f8b1\n:END:\n"},{"count":21,"value":"#+title: Holonomy arises through the curvature of parameter space\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":169,"value":": physics phase\n\n* Just like an angle difference arises when you [[file:20210511111338-parallel_transport.org][Parallel transport]]  a vector through a curved physical space, a /[[file:20210511110338-phase_quantum.org][Phase (quantum)]] / difference ([[file:20210511110305-holonomy.org][Holonomy]] ) arises when you [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatically]] transport a quantum state through parameter space\n\nThis means that phase/holonomy is a measure of how \"curved\" parameter space is.\n\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210511111338-parallel_transport.org","oid":"91f4bc185905112d7b5ac88e447923bb4624d8f0","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       71b7fa31-7712-4a3a-a3ff-825298ed86cd\n:END:\n"},{"count":9,"value":"#+title: Parallel transport\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":202,"value":": definition mathematics\n\n* Parallel transport\n\nWhen you *parallel transport* a vector through some curved space, it will, in general, not end up at the exact same angle (wrt to the origin) as it had at the start.\n\nYou can think of parallel transport as taking a vector /tangent/ to the surface of some manifold on a journey from and then back to its starting point.\n\nIt is, in general, /path dependent/: it matters /how/ you get to the endpoint, not just /where/.\n\n[[./media/ptransport.png]]\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210511115926-wavefunctions_are_waves_and_do_wave_things.org","oid":"876532aa3b1e13ffceaa5e4be85c5726f9faf21c","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       37c25546-4135-4012-b414-7747d6cedb2a\n:END:\n"},{"count":19,"value":"#+title: Wavefunctions are waves and do wave things\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":472,"value":": duh waves quantum\n\n* Quantum mechanical wavefunctions are functions... of waves!\n\nThis is such a dumb thing that I'm almost embarrassed to admit it, but it's easy to forget that wavefunctions are, in fact, waves, and the terms which describe them are related if not identical to the terms describing waves.\n\nThe biggest one is [[file:20210511110338-phase_quantum.org][Phase (quantum)]].

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[file:20210218153430-fermions.org][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[file:20210218153456-bosons.org][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[file:20210223152109-spin.org][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[file:20210218152909-anyons.org][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\nThis might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n** 1.4 Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons. If we were to examine the anyons first .....\n\n* The quantum hall effect\n** Once again, what is it\n*** Classical Hall effect\n\n[[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\n*** Preliminaries\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n\n To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels.

In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[file:20210309164701-perturbation_theory.org][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\nDo this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n\"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality \\eqref{eq:perturbation} to hold.\n\nIdeally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n** Writing down the LWF\n\nThis problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\nWhile this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small. Instead it is guessed and shown to be similar enough to the actual WF to be useful.\n$N=\\frac{AB}{\\phi_0}e^-$\n$\\hbar\\omega_B >> E_{cont}>>V_{disorder}$\nThe Laughlin WF only applies to the filling fractions of $\\nu=\\frac{1}{m}$\n\n*** Step one is admitting you have a problem\n\n How is it guessed?

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\nTo see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[file:20210223141818-filling_factor.org][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\n(note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\nThe handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n\\]\nIf we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n. However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\nNow, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\nTo get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[file:20210223172322-aharonov_bohm_effect.org][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[file:20210312130104-berry_connection.org][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[file:20210223171329-adiabatic_theorem_quantum.org][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[file:20210223170728-berry_phase.org][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n* The explanation of anyons\n\n  #+include: \"./20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org\" :minlevel 4\n\n[[file:20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org][The configuration space explanation chapter]]\n\n#+include: \"./20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org\" :minlevel 4\n[[file:20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n** TODO \n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210414155705-proof_ballspace_is_not_simply_connected.org][Proof ballspace is not simply connected]]\n\n#+transclude: t :level 2\n[[file:20210414155524-how_does_qm_work_in_non_simply_connected_space.org][How does QM work in non-simply connected space?]]\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[file:20210414155618-how_to_justify_particles_not_being_able_to_escape.org][How to justify particles not being able to escape]]\n\n* Footnotes\n\n[fn:3] The spin-statistics theorem is only provable in relativistic quantum mechanics.

Therefore, since small 3D is not approximately 2D, the 2D idealization is truly indispensible to our explanation of the emergence of anyons and we therefore ought to take it ontologically seriously.\n\nNow that we have finally grasped the core of Shech's argument, we are at last able to push back a little. At the end of this chapter, I will have shown how to fully make sense of the emergence of anyons in the quantum Hall system without relying on the 2D idealization. Before that however, I want to make it at least somewhat plausible that this /can/ be done.\n\nTo start, as we have seen above, to derive the existence of anyons, i.e. particles whose phase under exchange $\\neq 0,1$ , we do not necessarily require the configuration space to be $2D$, but merely for said configuration space to be non-[[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]]. Therefore, it seems plausible that an approximate 3D explanation could get off the ground, if only we can show that it is non-simply connected. The rest of the chapter serves as that argument.\n\n** First steps\n\nTo gain some confidence in the idea, let us  prove that an idealized /3D/  configuration space can also be non-simply connected. The key reason why the 3D configuration space constructed previously is necessarily simply connected is due to the fact that we 'merely' have a zero-dimensional hole at the origin where the two particles would intersect, which, since we also want to describe fermions, is forbidden by the Pauli-exclusion principle.[fn:1]  According to our current best scientific theories, fermions (and presumably the anyons under question as well) are understood best as point-particles, and thus the intersection being a single point in configuration space seems to be justified. I claim, however, that if this condition would be relaxed, allowing for a larger \"forbidden\" space, then,  in conjunction with two other plausible premises, we arrive at a multiply connected 3D configuration space. If this sounds rather ad-hoc, that is because it is. The final argument will not rely on these assumptions, so for now I believe they cause little harm. although I will attempt some minor justification at the end of this section.\n\nThe main idea is the following: if the minimum distance between the particles is greater then the \"height\" of the configuration space (here the size of the QH system), the 3d configuration space becomes multiply connected as well, as there are no paths which will \"loop over\" the singularity points. Imagine a box with a billiard ball in the middle which pokes out of the top and bottom, this is a reasonable model for now for the possible configurations of the particles.\n\nTo construct this configuration space we require three conditions on top of the ones already mentioned before ($(\\mathbf{r_1}, \\mathbf{r_2})=(\\mathbf{r_2, r_1})$ and $|r|\\neq 0$)\n1. $\\Psi(r_i\\geq b_i)=0$ where $b_i \\quad i=x,y,z$ are the dimensions of the quantum Hall system. This says: the probability of finding the particle outside the quantum Hall system is $0$, which is not exactly true but for now works as a useful assumption, modeling the boundaries of the system as an infinite potential well\n2. $\\Psi(|r|\\leq a)=0$, where $a$ is some real number representing the minimum allowed distance between the two particles\n3. $b_x, b_y\\geq a \\geq b_z$ (or really any of the dimensions, it just needs to be )\n\nBoth of these will be argued for in more detail below, but for now I claim that /if/ $\\exists a\\geq \\beta\\in \\mathbb{R} \\quad \\Psi(r\\leq a)=0$, where \\beta is the height of the fractional quantum Hall system and \\alpha the minimum distance allowed between the two particles, then the resulting configuration space will be non-simply connected.\n\nTo briefly sketch an intuitive picture, let us recall our $d$-dimensional configuration space @@latex: \\eqref{confspaceddim} @@ and the fact that we are only really interested in the latter half of that configuration space, as the absolute position of the particles (e.g. the location of the quantum Hall system) should not really matter. So we are just looking at the paths in\n\\[S=\\frac{\\mathbb{R} ^3-\\Delta }{Z_2} \\]\n\nNow we add our conditions above. 2) creates a sphere of forbidden particle positions around the origin (where the particles are near one another), which we can model as subtracting those a sphere of radius $\\alpha$, called  $\\sigma$, from the configuration space. Since \\sigma encompasses the points \\Delta, we can leave out \\Delta. Additionally,  1) means we are excising the points outside of the QH system, which I will represent with $\\beta$ , which are the points ranging from $[-\\frac{b_i}{2},+\\frac{b_i}{2}] \\quad i=x,y,z$ .[fn:2] Thus creating our new configuration space for $2$ particles\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tilde{Q}'= \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^{3} -\\sigma -\\beta  }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:goodconf}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhich can be crudely represented as\n[[./media/ballspace.png]]\n#+caption: Exaggerated representation of $\\tilde{Q}'$\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ballspace\n\n*** \"Proof\"\n$\\tilde{Q}'$ is clearly non-simply connected, as there are loops that can be formed around the center of the space which cannot possibly be deformed into a point.

In case of the fundamental group, the relevant respect is the number of [[file:20210427162825-homotopy_equivalent_paths.org][Homotopy equivalent paths]], the classes of paths which cannot be continuously deformed into one another. In a non-simply connected space, a path which winds around a \"hole\" cannot continuously be deformed into one which does not, nor can a path which winds around said hole twice be deformed into one that only winds around it once, or winds around it twice clockwise.\n\nLuckily for us, the  homotopy equivalent paths of  $\\tilde{Q}'$ are the same as those for $\\tilde{Q}$ , as all the paths that wind around the \"origin-hole\"  $k$ times can be continuously deformed into one another in both cases, and no other winding-sites exist. If our space would have additional holes, that could pose a problem, but for now we can rest easy.\n\nThus, since the number of homotopy classes is the same, the fundamental group is also identical, namely $B_N$ for $N$ particles. Therefore the $1D$ rep will remain the same, and the particles will not be limited to a phase of $0$  or $1$, and therefore anyons are possible.\n\n\n** Justifying the conditions\nWhile I will give some justification below, let us consider one line of argument: since (presumably) the configuration space just constructed allows for the existence of anyons, why do we not simply discard our previous idealization and insert this one into the EIA? Sure, it has some quirks, but the condition that particles cannot come within a certain distance of one another is hardly more problematic than assuming the particles cannot move in an entire dimension. The additional criterion of the wavefunction being zero outside the QH system similarly appears less restrictive than the 2D idealization. Can we then just assume that this is a strictly better model to use?\n\nUnfortunately, not quite. While assumptions 1. and 2. might be brushed off in this way, accepting 3. without further justification =is not nice=. Unlike the /2D/ idealization, performing an inference to the best explanation also does not appear quite satisfactory, as the condition is so specific that unjustified acceptance makes it ~too ad hoc~.\n\n*(My idea for justifying this was to find a way to express the probability of finding the particle in the z direction and contrast that with the Coulomb force, but I wasn't able to find the former. Shech cites a $10^{-45}$  probability for it, but he doesn't justify or cite it. In the end it does not really matter as this is just a proof of concept, but would be nice to have)*\n\n# The AB effect also has such a strong idealization. Underscription of idealizations.\n\n* Footnotes\n[fn:2] It's /2 in order to have the origin be set at zero.\n\n[fn:1] Unless further argued for, this statement is technically begging the question, as the Pauli-exclusion principle is a consequence of the phases being a certain way and probably should not be assumed. There exist less ad-hoc ways of formalizing this constraint, which, however, do often rely on specific interpretations of quantum mechanics, see for instance cite:Brown1999.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1}],"additions":153,"deletions":17},{"oid":"10b907e6b03e3ee40b17987fde976ad8ea6566eb","message":"Scripted auto-commit on change (2021-07-01 19:53:33) by gitwatch.sh\n","date":1625162013,"files":[{"filepath":"20210403122310-a_knot_is_a_braid_connected_back_to_itself.org","oid":"057be039d407d270954125f8b66dfda680748a14","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       d699b056-c2f8-4f13-8549-2fd38d636eba\n:END:\n"},{"count":23,"value":"#+title: A knot is a braid connected back to itself\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":61,"value":": topology definition braid\n\nA knot is a braid connected back to itself, the strand on the left at the top connected to the strand at the bottom left.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210403175440-first_homotopy_group_pi_1.org","oid":"c988917b8dbb6b1b419198caf631a0b21d148c85","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       803d6df6-3d4c-4471-b3bd-a022fad8d1ee\n:END:\n"},{"count":13,"value":"#+title: First homotopy group pi_1\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":163,"value":": topology definition\n\n* First homotopy group\n\nThe first homotopy group $\\pi_1$ of a configuration space is the [[file:20210403175539-group.org][Group]] formed by inequivalent paths passing through a  given point in the configuration space.\nThe elements are the groups are paths (or more precisely, their traversal), with multiplication being defined as traversing two paths succesively, and the inverse being the traversal of the path backwards (identity being the point path).\n\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210403175539-group.org","oid":"a7ac43dfe69e18d5691b51e6cc1bf1863db496cc","diff":[{"count":3,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:"},{"count":1,"value":"\n"},{"count":13,"added":true,"value":":ID:       0bbb9ce7-191f-4fde-8924-cad8a3886e2e"},{"count":1,"value":"\n"},{"count":3,"added":true,"value":":END:"},{"count":1,"value":"\n"},{"count":3,"added":true,"value":"\n\n\n"},{"count":7,"value":"#+title: Group\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":216,"value":": topology definition\n\n* Group\nA group $G$ is any set of functions $f_1 ...$ and a multiplication operator $\\ocircle$ for which holds\n1) [[file:20210403184843-closure_group.org][Closure]] $\\forall i,j \\quad f_i\\ocircle f_j \\in G$\n2) [[file:20210403185137-associativity.org][Associativity]]  $\\forall i,j,k \\quad (f_i\\ocircle f_j)\\ocircle f_k=f_i \\ocircle (f_j \\ocircle f_j)$\n3) Identity element: $\\exists e : \\forall i \\quad e \\ocircle f_i=f_i$\n4) Inverse element: $\\forall i \\exists f_i^-1\\quad f_i\\ocircle f_i^-1=e$\n\n"}],"additions":12,"deletions":1}],"additions":30,"deletions":3},{"oid":"c8892b4fae179785d6e849045d303f968e9af677","message":"Scripted auto-commit on change (2021-07-01 19:54:14) by gitwatch.sh\n","date":1625162054,"files":[{"filepath":"20210330125526-symmetry_arguments_are_more_interesting_than_symmetry_properties.org","oid":"37ac1a51b51f9416b1786ce7b7b5f383bf4d4207","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       78ecef7c-f9d9-4384-b6dc-7a5031414fff\n:END:\n"},{"count":21,"value":"#+title: Symmetry arguments are more interesting than symmetry properties\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":323,"value":": symmetry\n\n* It is important to distinguish between symmetry arguments and symmetry properties, and to mostly focus on the former\n\nSymmetry properties are properties of translational, rotational, reflection, reversal etc. invariance which are attributed to certain phenomena or laws.

of thinking is tempting, and I myself \"fall into\" this trap quite often, I ~believe~ can see that thinking of explanation as having different levels of acceptability to be much more

In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named \"anyons\".\n\nA particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.\n\n** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space\n\nHow do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?\nWe have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.\n\nAs mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.\n\nUsing the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.\n\n** Naive exchange\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):\n\nWe start out with a wavefunction $\\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_1\\psi_2\\]\n\nIf we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [[file:20210210115635-phase_transitions.org][phase transitions]]\n\n\\[\\Psi_\\pi=e^{i\\theta\\pi}\\psi_2\\psi_1\\]\n\nExchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with\n\n\\[\\Psi_{2\\pi}=e^{i2\\pi\\theta}\\Psi_0\\]\n\nTherefore, $e^{i2\\pi\\theta}=1 \\rightarrow e^{i\\pi\\theta}=\\pm 1$, which leads to $\\theta=0 \\lor \\theta=1$.\n\nWe have therefore \"shown\" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\\theta=0$) and fermions ($\\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.\n\n** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not \"the operator framework\" )\n\nWhat we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.\n\n(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)\n\nThe three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation\n\n\\begin{equation}\n[S_i,S_j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K\n    \\label{eq:spincomm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nIf we take the state $\\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^2\\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:spinsquared}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\nS_3\\ket{s,m}=m\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:s3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nthen we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^+\\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\\ket{s,m+1}=\\ket{s,m'}\n    \\label{eq:splus}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf we require $\\sqrt{|\\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\ns(s+1)-m(m+1)\\geq0 \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:posnorm}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq s \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:ms}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIt is clear then, that for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so\n\\begin{equation}\ns-m= n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:int}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimilarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s=n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:mpluss}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining \\eqref{eq:int} and \\eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s+s-m=2s=n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow s=\\frac{n}{2}\n    \\label{eq:proofofinteger}\n\\end{equation}\nSince $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.\n\nSo, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.\n\n*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng\n\n*** TODO Spin statistics relation\n\n\n** Configuration space framework\n\nThe above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.\n\nLuckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows\n\n1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles\n2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space\n3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange\n\nIt almost seems too easy.\n\nLet's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).\n\nWithout any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d\\]\n\nHowever, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.\n\n\n\nWe need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )\n\nLet us call the set of diagonal points $\\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\\mathbf{r}=(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})$.\n\n\nThen, for our configuration space looks like\n\\begin{equation}\nQ= \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d  - \\Delta }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:confspaceddim}\n\\end{equation}\n\n# =just blantantly copied=\nIn order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can \"discard\" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in\n\\begin{equation}\nS=\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d -\\Delta}{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:S}\n\\end{equation}\n\nBefore showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....\n\n*** 3D\nLet's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\\Delta$, which for $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1 -\\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).\n\n[[./media/3dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\n\n=Copying again=\n\nAn exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be \"looping it around\" the sphere (path C).\n\nWhat is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.\n\nNow we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha^2=+1 \\rightarrow \\alpha = \\pm 1\n    \\label{eq:doubleexchange}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.\n\n\n*** 2D\n\nLet us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.\n\n[[./media/2dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 2D exchange\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\nWe make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.\n\nHowever, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the \"string\" cannot collapse to single point in principle.\n\nTherefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\\alpha$ has no effect on $|\\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}\n    \\label{eq:phasephase}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n*** Connection to the Braid group\n\nThe above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [[file:20210403183452-simply_connected.org][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way?

Is there even a good explanation there?\n*** [ ] In how much details should I treat non-abelian anyons?\n* The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n** Part I (Brief, <4k): The motivation for looking at the FQHE gets explained, namely the fact that something appears to be explained with an infinite idealization, with reference to my introduction and Shech's article,\n\n*** a. /b/ The FQHE is briefly introduced, namely the weird bumps and a hint of mentioning anyons and that the reason for this is that the config space is 2D\n\n\n*** b. /a/ This 2D explanation is identified as an infinitesimal idealization, one which has been claimed to play a key role in the /explanation/ of the effect, and explanation => existence. It should be clear how weirdly different this explanation is from other more common ones, such as classical ones. Also it should be emphasized how universal this explanation is, such as the fact that the location of the bumps does not even depend on the material.\n\n\n*** c. It is argued that if this explanation would succeed in the way described above, we would have a reasonable case for an actual sectioning off of reality? Here it must be clear why this effect is so useful to study, but also what I will do when it does not turn out to be so dramatic, i.e. how I will generalize\n\n** Part II (Long, ~10k): The details of the FQHE are laid bare, with little interpretation going on in order for the actual \"explanation\" of the effect to be as clear as possible, mostly based on Tong\n\n*** d. The groundwork needed for the explanation to get things of the ground is laid: the CHE is explained in more detail, Landau levels are introduced and the distinction between the Integer and Fractional QHE is clarified, and the former is (for now) made clear to be less important to explain\n\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n*****  To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[file:20210223154027-landau_levels.org][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n*****  Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting a vibe of the thing\n\n***** Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n...\n\n**** Quantization\n\n***** The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[file:20210223154511-lagrangian.org][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[file:20210317122727-hamiltonian.org][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[file:20210317122807-poisson_brackets.org][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[file:20210317122922-canonical_commutation_relation.org][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[file:20210317123047-harmonic_oscillator.org][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[file:20210317123126-hilbert_space.org][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n***** First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n*****  From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n***** Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n*****  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\nOperators are functions which spit out other functions, rather than a scalar or vector.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTada\n\n**** Important details and idealizations\n\n***** Astute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\n***** An additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n[[file:20210223162026-the_dimensions_of_the_hall_system_is_set_to_2_from_the_start.org][The dimensions of the Hall system is set to 2 from the start]]\n\n\n*** e. The FQHE is set up in more detail, with the goal of making clear which idealizing assumptions are made, such as the LWF, the plasma analogy and why the toy model is needed. It is again emphasized that the FQHE is explained more in a \"making plausible\" way rather than a \"derivation way\", and seeds are planted as to what this will imply for the kind of explanation (not DN) under study\n\n**** Dawdling\n***** Now that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n\n***** I don't want to look at the IQHE too much, as while it is interesting, its explanation does not require nearly the same idealizations as its fractional counterpart.\n\n***** However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n***** There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\n****** The Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n****** The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n\n***** For those reasons we will be skipping a thorough examination of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect and jump straight into the FQHE\n\n**** FQHE\n\n***** The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n****** Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer Counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same ~ballpark~ solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\n****** It would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n- [[file:20210309164800-the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n- [[file:20210311184105-the_fqh_state_is_interpreted_as_a_plasma_to_allow_for_intuitions.org][The FQH State Is Interpreted as a Plasma to Allow for Intuitions and Computation]]\n- The LWF is not even an actual ground state of the FQH Hamiltonian, instead from it we derive a Toy Hamiltonian of which the LWF is the ground state, bringing us even further from our goal.\n\n-[[file:20210319113940-fractional_statistics_can_only_be_calculated_using_adiabaticity.org][Fractional Statistics can Only be Calculated Using Adiabaticity]]\n****** Using these assumptions/idealizations however, we can make it plausible that FQ statistics are happening, I don't think we will use much more.\n\n****** The wavefunction under consideration is called the Laughlin Wave Function, thought up by >>Laughlin in 1983 after the experimental observation of the FQHE in 1982 by ...\n\n****** Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

Crucially, one rather popular explanation of the FQHE necessarily employs an infinitesimal idealization, namely that the configuration space of the electrons involved is 2D. The configuration space of electrons is always 3D, so this is a classic example of an idealization as a fiction used to explain something. However, contra cite:Strevens2019a, I argue that this idealization cannot be construed as one which gets rid of a variable irrelevant to the explanation, as this infinite idealization is /crucial/ to the whole explanation: without it there is no explanation.\n\nBut, I am getting ahead of myself. The FQHE is not easily summarized in a short paragraph, and the rest of this chapter will be dedicated to providing a rudimentary understanding of the effect and its \"causes\".\n\n\n** The [[file:20210218152105-classical_hall_effect.org][classical hall effect]]\n\nBefore we start to describe the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, we should first understand Quantum Hall effects more generally. To do /that/, a short description of the classical Hall Effect is in order.\n\nThe classical Hall effect can be briefly described as the measurement of a voltage /across/ (transversally) a thin conducting plate trough which a current is run in the longitudinal direction and which is subject to a magnetic field perpendicular to both, as in Figure \\ref{fig:che}\n\n#+caption: set up of the che, stolen from cite:Shech2019\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:che\n[[./media/che.png]]\n\nClassically, we can explain the observation of this voltage by the fact that the electrons travelling in the longitudinal direction experience a Lorentz force $\\textbf{F} = q\\textbf{E} + q\\textbf{v} \\times \\textbf{B}$, which causes them to be redirected to one of the sides of the plate. This leads to a gradient of electrons along the transversal axis, i.e. a voltage difference. Instead of a voltage, the resistance is usually measured.\n\nThe classical Hall effect is relatively well understood and, frankly, quite boring.\n\nThe classical quantum hall effect happens around .......\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect(s)\n:LOGBOOK:\nCLOCK: [2021-03-09 Tue 09:51]\n:END:\n\nThings start to get more interesting once the strength of the magnetic field is increased quite a bit. We start to observe plateaux at regular intervals in the transversal resistance.\n#+caption: qhe\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe.png]]\n\nWe would of course like to know what explains the appearance of these plateaux.\n\nAt even stronger magnetic fields and even cleaner samples, we start to see even more plateaux.\n\n\n...\n\nLet us first focus our attention on the lower magnetic field range, which gives rise to the socalled /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/. First observed in XXXX by YY, the effect gets its name from the plateaux appearing at integer multiples of the \"quantum of resistance\".\n\n** Quantum of Resistance\n\n\\[R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi\\]\n\n\nThis is strange, as from the classical quantum hall effect we expect the transversal resistance to vary linearly with the strength of the magnetic field.\n\n** Landau levels\n\nThe IQHE comes from the impurities present in the sample: the \"pure\" energy eigenstates of the system would not lead plateaux. The impurities can be modeled as a random potential. This random potential breaks the degeneracy of the Landau levels and \"smooths them out\", like\n#+caption: smooth landau, stolen from Tong.\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:nondegenlandau\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\nIn addition, the disorder causes the energy levels to be split up into /extended/ and /localized/ energy states, like\n#+caption: extended v localized, also Tong\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended v localized\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nOnly the extended energy levels carry current, the localized ones do not. Furthermore, the extended ones are favored? In any case, as the magnetic field strength increases, so does the energy of the states, so they get pushed up to a new energy level. However, they first have to fill the localized states before they are able to reach a new extended state, and all these localized states do not conduct i.e. do not contribute to the conductivity i.e. do not change the resistance of the material. Tada, you got plateaux.\n\nAt this point one may have some questions: these extended states sound like they are about the longitudinal resistance, not the transversal. Furthermore, if the extended states gets less populated and the localized states more populated over the course of a plateaux, why does the resistivity not just shoot up since there are so many less conductive states?\n\nThe answer to the latter is that the extended states will end up conducting more, somehow.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210309112810-infinite_idealizations_resemble_sorites_because_both_have_discontinuous_transitions.org","oid":"2f5c190a341848c9e1a54ce987968513bcc3a612","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       37bfaecb-92e6-4cd7-9735-2b6c940c0e03\n:END:\n"},{"count":23,"value":"#+title: Infinite idealizations resemble Sorites because both have discontinuous transitions\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":909,"value":": vagueness central thesis\n\n\n* Context\n\nMy thesis heavily centers around two topics: [[file:20201219152020-infinite_idealizations.org][infinite idealizations]] and [[file:20210114163906-vagueness.org][vagueness]]/[[file:20210309112947-sorites_paradox.org][sorites paradox]].

A man with 100000 hairs is not bald.\n2. If a man with N hairs is not bald, a man with N-1 hairs is not bald.\n   ...\n3. A man with 0 hairs is not bald.\n\n3 seems false, but 1 seems true, so to fix this we can negate 2.\n1. A man with 100000 hairs is not bald.\n2. \\not 2\n3. There is a point at which a man with N hairs is not bald but at N-1 is bald.\n\n3 seems false again, this time illustrating that we do not believe we can't draw lines that well.\n\nNow for Inf Ids.\n\n1. We do not observe the FQHE normally because the configuration space of the electrons is 3D\n2. If the configuration space is 3D at n thickness/magnetic field strength, then the configuration space is 3D at n/2 thickness/ 2n magnetic field strength.\n...\n3. We never observe the FQHE\n\nOr, other way around again\n\n1. 1.\n2. \\not 2\n...\n3. There is a point where n thickness/magnetic field strength does not yield the FQHE, but n/2 thickness/ 2n magnetic field strength does.\n\n3 also seems objectionable here, as we don't believe this symmethy is this easily broken\n\n\n\n* THE MAJOR SIMILARITY IS THAT FOR BOTH CASES WE DO NOT HAVE A MECHANISM FOR DETERMINING /WHEN/ THIS CHANGE WOULD OCCUR.\n\nSo if the vagueness paradox is a problem for baldness than it is also a problem for this.\n\nAh.

Examples I encountered include:\n+ the distinction between science and psuedoscience (Popper, Kuhn)\n+ the distinction between observables and unobservables (van Fraassen, ...)\n+ naming \"the meter\" (Wittgenstein, Kripke)\n+ measuring a \"real number\" in a physics experiment\n+ computing, producing a digital output from a continuous system\n+ ...\n\nAlso useful to keep in mind: this idea is \"essentially\" an argument against essentialism. This is a useful keyword to search for.\n* Thought\n\nIn my view, human reasoning consists of two conflicting tendencies:\n1. We wish to reason deductively and grab onto discrete, somewhat abstract propositions which we can assign truth values\n2. We wish to see \"the real world\", specifically spacetime, as continuous, in the sense that we believe it is infinitely divisible, without gaps.\n   - My hunch is that the fact that spacetime is continuous lies behind this, but the conflict might also come forth from a more general, unavoidable vagueness of concepts, see [[file:20201221131054-continuity_vs_vagueness.org][Continuity vs. Vagueness]]\n     + Sub-hunch: the vagueness argument is more about justifying the naming of n F's as G and naming n+1 F's as H, while the continuity argument is stonger and prevents one from chopping up things into categories at all.\n\nThese are in conflict. A good way to illustrate this is analyzing the concept of a \"human\". Is it possible over all of time and space to pick out those and only those things that are humans? I don't think this is possible for many reasons:\na. Concept-wise, it is difficult to say what are humans and what are non-humans. We have two concrete cases of what are humans and what are not: associate professor Dr. Liam Bright is definitely a human, but a goldfish is definitely not. However, when exactly was the first human was born? There is a somewhat continuous line from me to a far away ancestor which we would not label human. Unless we somewhat arbitrarily draw a line, say, 2 million years ago, we cannot really pick out all the nonhumans from the humans this way.\n   + This is more related to the vagueness argument than the continuity argument, although I feel like they are the same, I should come up with a more general word for this.\n     - TODO come up with a better word for this\nb. Time-wise, it is difficult to say when even an individual human \"starts\". We have to concrete cases of when a human exists and when not: when a person is 30 years old they are definitely human that exists, but before their parents were born they definitely did not exist yet. While I myself am not in favor of arguing that life starts at conception, it seems like the only natural starting point for what constitutes an individual human, otherwise you'd have to argue for \"X\" number of cells starts to make a human, again speaking ontologically. However, even if we decide to be hardcore bible-thumpers and claim that life starts at \"conception\", when is that? Is it when the sperm touches the egg-cell? But when IS that? Since time and space are continuous, there are an uncountable number of instants in where the sperm touches the egg for the first time: there is no \"first touch\". One might be inclined to specify are period of time instead, but, as I will argue later, this is just kicking the can down the road, as the process of going from non-human to human is now just ignored over this small time interval.\nc. Space-wise, it is difficult to say where exactly a human phyiscally \"ends\". We have to concrete cases of where a human exists and when not: the center of a living human's brain is definitely part of them, but the center of the sun is definitely not. However, where EXACTLY does a human begin and end? A natural guess it at the end of their epidermis. Their epidermis is made up of molecules, and the last \"epidermis\" molecule is where the human ends. Even barring humans shedding skin and replacing their cells, the epidermis molecules is not a precise enough end. Molecules are made up of atoms, which consist of electrons and a core. We know that their relation is not as one of a sun and its planets, instead electrons are more akin to a cloud surrounding the core (which in itself is not so definitely positioned). This \"cloud\", however, extends as far space itself! Surely, the probability of finding the electron further than 1mm from the nucleus is already astronomically low, but it is non-zero. Where does one create the cut-off point? Even if one picks their favorite interpretation of QM where everything might have a definite position, then still the fact that space is continuous prevents us from creating a definite cutoff point\n   - Kind of weak near the end, specifiy further.\n\nI claim that it is not possible to assign ontological status to both. In order to reason soundly, then, we must do either one of the following\n1. Give up the idea that spacetime is fundamentally continuous. This means that there are discrete units of space and time, which we could then group and give meaning to. For instance, a human could be defined as starting to exist at conception, which would be a definite instance in time and space.\n2. Give up on the idea of ontological discrete groupings/concepts. Ontologically, there is no such thing as a human. While many might be willing to bite that particular bullet, this has far reaching consequences. Almost nothing would be justifiably ontologically real, except those things that could be mapped to the continuum of spacetime and exists on the same \"level\" as it. Basically, we can reason, but all our categories would be fundamentally arbitrary. This does not mean they are not useful, but that they cannot be part of the ontological furniture of the world.\n(3. Reason \"continuously\". If we were somehow able to reason just using continuous arguments, this might work. However, I don't know what this looks like.)\n\n* Refs\nThis topic is deeply related to a breadth of other topics.

For instance, discussions surrounding essentialism have been around since Plato and are very closely connected to the topic at hand. Even though my thesis will not per se be an argument against essentialism, I should look at how this topic is tackled in order to\n   a) regain my enthousiasm for my thesis. My passion against essentialism transcends my distaste of Platonism and is what I actually want to tackle. Just talking about Platonism is too abstract, I need easier examples\n   b) find additional routes to tackle this topic. If this has either been done before very satisfactorily or in a way similar to my goals, it makes no sense at all try and construct myself out of this hole. Good philosophers think of things themselves, great philosophers let others do the thinking for them.\n c) know what not to do and which side-tracks to avoid.

He argues that these kinds, when important for EXPLANATION or induction, have certain properties which are also necessary properties of natural kinds, and should therefore be treated similarly. These properties are\n                1. These kinds are defined a posteriori rather than socially \"invented\". There is phenomenon happening which we later give a name to, like gender. Gender in the abstract was introduced way later than gender norms.\n                2. The way we use these kinds in explanation or inductions requres that it be defined \"by a cluster of properties whose membership is determined by the CAUSAL STRUCTURE of the world\" and is therefore independent of our social conventions in that sense.\n                3. The way the relationship between the kind and the term that refers to it is established does not depend on our conventions but on the \"existence of an epistemically relevant pattern of causal relations between instantiations of the kind and the term in question\"\n\n                Sooo Boyd does argue in favor a broader definition of natural kinds, and possibly for there existence? He takes causation to be quite important which is always a risky move to make, but might work out for him.\n\n                His appeal to the explanatory power of the candidate natural kinds is very similar (probably even the same) kind of appeal Platonists make to the indispensability argument.

This note is an attempt to clarify what the problem is and how to tackle it.\n\n* Body\n\nThe problem with Streven's, Norton's and perhaps Batterman's discussions about infinite idealizations or asymptotic idealizations, is that they distinguish infinite idealizations from other things, be that normal idealizations or approximations, by the operation by which they are achieved, BUT then discuss the merits or results of that operation, which then invariably introduces another distinction: between infinite idealizations which do not smoothly approach the limit, and everything else. The latter is generally seen to be unproblematic, at least in the sense that scientific representation or modelling is assumed to be unproblematic. The former is where the difficulties lie and where disagreement arises, at least in the context of the discussion on infinite idealizations. Few people would disagree with Norton by saying that approximations are something else, they disagree that all infinite idealizations can be explained away as approximations, namely those infinite idealizations that do not smoothly approach the limit.\n\nI propose therefore that, in discussions about infinite idealizations, we distinguish first and formost between the following (nomenclature subject to revision):\n\n** Disinction\n*** Continuous operations\nNon discontinuous operations, converging limits, non-problematic idealizations, approximations etc. all fall in this class. They are relatively unproblematic, in the sense that there is no major dispute about whether or not the ought to be used at all or whether they /are/ used in science. They include Norton's approximations and Streven's simple idealizations, but also Norton's converging infinite idealizations and Strevens' \"non-interesting\" asymptotic idealization.\n\n*** Discontinuous operations\nThis is just the class of those infinite/asymptotic idealizations which do not smoothly approach the limit. I think this is the interesting class, and the one we should distinguish.\n\n** Merit\n\nThe merit of this approach, I claim, is that we now both distinguish between the operation which arrives at these idealization as well as their result, and thus do not get bogged down with discussions or distractions about the \"easily understood\" idealizations belonging to the class of infinite idealizations. It just doesn't make sense to look at them like that.\n\n** Disadvantage\n\na) This distinction doesn't say anything specific about WHAT is discontinuous, it matters a lot which property you're looking at I think\nb) This distinction groups a lot of things together under \"continuous\", operations and concepts between which we can distinguish further. Approximations are not idealizations and it is useful to note the difference, but the problem with distinguishing only arises when (in this case) the promotion relation doesn't work. This failure of promotion is the interesting factor, not the conceptualization of an idealization as separate model. While this conceptualization is interesting to talk about, it is not what is at stake, and Norton's distinction has done some harm in this regard.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210119144549-categorization_of_idealizations.org","oid":"0d8cbbc74cdc214eb480c7d4f32dae4d7be6da4b","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       3c3b33a1-b8db-4be9-8acc-244cc7230172\n:END:\n"},{"count":11,"value":"#+title: Categorization of idealizations\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":1881,"value":": thesis distinction idealizations\n\nNicer version [[file:infinite_idealizations_chapter.org][small sample on infinite vs normal idealization]]\n* Good distinciton\n\nI want to find a way to distinguish between all the ways people distinguish between idealizations, because there are too damn many.\n** Idealization\nSome model that's (intentionally) false in some respect\n*** Simple\nAn idealization which is achieved by setting a paramater to a certain value, such as zero.\n- Frictionless plane\n\n  They are direct and unproblematic.\n*** Infinite\nAn idealization which is made by doing some sort of limiting operation such that a parameter goes to zero or infinity\nIt's rarely just \"one\" model but often some sort of sequence of models considered as a whole.

We can imagine that the surface/volume ratio of an infinite sphere is 1/r, but an infinite sphere does not exist\n  - FQHE: 2D electrons do not exist\n  - TDL: there are no infinite molecules, nor are molecules infinitely small\n  - AB effect: there are no infinite solenoids\n  - Population drift: there are no infinite populations\n\n+ Problems\n  - It is difficult to see what exactly \"the limit system does not exist\" means. Norton was relatively clear on that, but other authors have been less clear.\n******* Contradiction in terms (analytic)\nHere the problem arises because an infinitely small or big process/entity/model cannot exist per the definition of the thing. A sphere is defined by the equidistant points from a center, but points infinitely far away cannot meaningfully be said to be equidistant. Or points infinitely far away aren't points? Whatever.\n\nThis requires us to be quite strict with our definitions, something which physical models rarely are.\n******* Contradiction somewhere else, usually physical (synthetic)\n\nHere the problem arises not because the stipulated entity could not be imagined with a property set to zero or infinity, but because this would contradict something else. I feel like most problems discussed of actual idealizations used in physics are of this kind, as they seem to contradict something uncontrovertible.\n\nAs cite:Shech2013 points out, for this to work you also need to stipulate that the idealization is real in some sense in order to force a strong contradiction. One way to do this is by using an indispensability argument.\n\n+ Examples\n  - FQHE: problem is that actual electrons are not 2D\n  - AB: problem is that actual solenoids are not infinite\n  - TDL: problem is that actual systems do not contain infinite amounts of molecules\n  - Population drift: problem is that actual populations cannot be infinite, because too many?\n\nIf feel like we can distinguish /even further/ here, namely between idealizations which set a value to infinity vs those that set a value to zero. Maybe this is a higher category, but I feel like the ones that set stuff to zero could have a chance of not being physically problematic, because we can imagine that property not being there. That would then be either above or below existence mismatch, or above problematic maybe. However this would just move the categorty of problematic lower.\n\nBut, some things can get set to zero and cause a problem, such as FQHE where 3D dimension is set to zero. So then it would be indirect->zero -> nonproblem/problem -> existence mismatch whatever\n****** Discontinuous limit\nProblematic indirect infinite idealization where the promotion fails because the infinite limit does make sense (in some way) but that there is a dicontinuous jump in the property that is indirectly affected\n+ Examples\n  - Longer and longer ellipsoid becomes an infinitely long cylinder, but an infinitely long cylinder has a different surface to volume ratio than any of the ellipsoids.\n  - Thermodynamic heat transfer/reversible process.\n    A reversible process is an idealization of an infinitely slow process such that the system stays in equilibrium all the time. As the \"heat transfer time interval\" goes to zero all is well, but at 0 no heat can be transfered. Here an arbitrarily slow process works, but an infinitely slow one does not.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210131113816-family_resemblance.org","oid":"7cdda1db9ac3936ed3badd7551763cf44899d8f1","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       c0baac3c-df95-44e9-8c78-5b4f8671232e\n:END:\n"},{"count":9,"value":"#+title: family resemblance\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":6,"value":": vagueness language\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":1},{"filepath":"20210204155921-if_you_cant_loop_back_to_your_introduction_make_shit_up_in_your_conclusion.org","oid":"d7ee0e44461282aa0608b7958dd75bb492e3356a","diff":[{"count":22,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       f5e4542f-0c24-4f50-bdfc-5e6d39ab8001\n:END:\n"},{"count":34,"value":"#+title: if you cant loop back to your introduction, make shit up in your conclusion\n#+"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"roam_tags"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"filetags"},{"count":372,"value":": writing thesis\n\n* Context\n\nHad a chat with Guido and Ronnie about my thesis, where we discussed my introduction ([[file:Introduction.org][Proselike introduction v1]]).

Examples I encountered include:\n+ the distinction between science and psuedoscience (Popper, Kuhn)\n+ the distinction between observables and unobservables (van Fraassen, ...)\n+ naming \"the meter\" (Wittgenstein, Kripke)\n+ measuring a \"real number\" in a physics experiment\n+ computing, producing a digital output from a continuous system\n+ ...\n\nAlso useful to keep in mind: this idea is \"essentially\" an argument against essentialism. This is a useful keyword to search for.\n* Thought\n\nIn my view, human reasoning consists of two conflicting tendencies:\n1. We wish to reason deductively and grab onto discrete, somewhat abstract propositions which we can assign truth values\n2. We wish to see \"the real world\", specifically spacetime, as continuous, in the sense that we believe it is infinitely divisible, without gaps.\n   - My hunch is that the fact that spacetime is continuous lies behind this, but the conflict might also come forth from a more general, unavoidable vagueness of concepts, see [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20201221131054"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"3a80df2a"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"continuity_vs_vagueness.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"77b4-4626-a9fe-933257549a07"},{"count":1968,"value":"][Continuity vs. Vagueness]]\n     + Sub-hunch: the vagueness argument is more about justifying the naming of n F's as G and naming n+1 F's as H, while the continuity argument is stonger and prevents one from chopping up things into categories at all.\n\nThese are in conflict. A good way to illustrate this is analyzing the concept of a \"human\". Is it possible over all of time and space to pick out those and only those things that are humans? I don't think this is possible for many reasons:\na. Concept-wise, it is difficult to say what are humans and what are non-humans. We have two concrete cases of what are humans and what are not: associate professor Dr. Liam Bright is definitely a human, but a goldfish is definitely not. However, when exactly was the first human was born? There is a somewhat continuous line from me to a far away ancestor which we would not label human. Unless we somewhat arbitrarily draw a line, say, 2 million years ago, we cannot really pick out all the nonhumans from the humans this way.\n   + This is more related to the vagueness argument than the continuity argument, although I feel like they are the same, I should come up with a more general word for this.\n     - TODO come up with a better word for this\nb. Time-wise, it is difficult to say when even an individual human \"starts\". We have to concrete cases of when a human exists and when not: when a person is 30 years old they are definitely human that exists, but before their parents were born they definitely did not exist yet. While I myself am not in favor of arguing that life starts at conception, it seems like the only natural starting point for what constitutes an individual human, otherwise you'd have to argue for \"X\" number of cells starts to make a human, again speaking ontologically. However, even if we decide to be hardcore bible-thumpers and claim that life starts at \"conception\", when is that? Is it when the sperm touches the egg-cell? But when IS that? Since time and space are continuous, there are an uncountable number of instants in where the sperm touches the egg for the first time: there is no \"first touch\". One might be inclined to specify are period of time instead, but, as I will argue later, this is just kicking the can down the road, as the process of going from non-human to human is now just ignored over this small time interval.\nc. Space-wise, it is difficult to say where exactly a human phyiscally \"ends\". We have to concrete cases of where a human exists and when not: the center of a living human's brain is definitely part of them, but the center of the sun is definitely not. However, where EXACTLY does a human begin and end? A natural guess it at the end of their epidermis. Their epidermis is made up of molecules, and the last \"epidermis\" molecule is where the human ends. Even barring humans shedding skin and replacing their cells, the epidermis molecules is not a precise enough end. Molecules are made up of atoms, which consist of electrons and a core. We know that their relation is not as one of a sun and its planets, instead electrons are more akin to a cloud surrounding the core (which in itself is not so definitely positioned). This \"cloud\", however, extends as far space itself! Surely, the probability of finding the electron further than 1mm from the nucleus is already astronomically low, but it is non-zero. Where does one create the cut-off point? Even if one picks their favorite interpretation of QM where everything might have a definite position, then still the fact that space is continuous prevents us from creating a definite cutoff point\n   - Kind of weak near the end, specifiy further.\n\nI claim that it is not possible to assign ontological status to both. In order to reason soundly, then, we must do either one of the following\n1. Give up the idea that spacetime is fundamentally continuous. This means that there are discrete units of space and time, which we could then group and give meaning to. For instance, a human could be defined as starting to exist at conception, which would be a definite instance in time and space.\n2. Give up on the idea of ontological discrete groupings/concepts. Ontologically, there is no such thing as a human. While many might be willing to bite that particular bullet, this has far reaching consequences. Almost nothing would be justifiably ontologically real, except those things that could be mapped to the continuum of spacetime and exists on the same \"level\" as it. Basically, we can reason, but all our categories would be fundamentally arbitrary. This does not mean they are not useful, but that they cannot be part of the ontological furniture of the world.\n(3.

This note is an attempt to clarify what the problem is and how to tackle it.\n\n* Body\n\nThe problem with Streven's, Norton's and perhaps Batterman's discussions about infinite idealizations or asymptotic idealizations, is that they distinguish infinite idealizations from other things, be that normal idealizations or approximations, by the operation by which they are achieved, BUT then discuss the merits or results of that operation, which then invariably introduces another distinction: between infinite idealizations which do not smoothly approach the limit, and everything else. The latter is generally seen to be unproblematic, at least in the sense that scientific representation or modelling is assumed to be unproblematic. The former is where the difficulties lie and where disagreement arises, at least in the context of the discussion on infinite idealizations. Few people would disagree with Norton by saying that approximations are something else, they disagree that all infinite idealizations can be explained away as approximations, namely those infinite idealizations that do not smoothly approach the limit.\n\nI propose therefore that, in discussions about infinite idealizations, we distinguish first and formost between the following (nomenclature subject to revision):\n\n** Disinction\n*** Continuous operations\nNon discontinuous operations, converging limits, non-problematic idealizations, approximations etc. all fall in this class. They are relatively unproblematic, in the sense that there is no major dispute about whether or not the ought to be used at all or whether they /are/ used in science. They include Norton's approximations and Streven's simple idealizations, but also Norton's converging infinite idealizations and Strevens' \"non-interesting\" asymptotic idealization.\n\n*** Discontinuous operations\nThis is just the class of those infinite/asymptotic idealizations which do not smoothly approach the limit. I think this is the interesting class, and the one we should distinguish.\n\n** Merit\n\nThe merit of this approach, I claim, is that we now both distinguish between the operation which arrives at these idealization as well as their result, and thus do not get bogged down with discussions or distractions about the \"easily understood\" idealizations belonging to the class of infinite idealizations. It just doesn't make sense to look at them like that.\n\n** Disadvantage\n\na) This distinction doesn't say anything specific about WHAT is discontinuous, it matters a lot which property you're looking at I think\nb) This distinction groups a lot of things together under \"continuous\", operations and concepts between which we can distinguish further. Approximations are not idealizations and it is useful to note the difference, but the problem with distinguishing only arises when (in this case) the promotion relation doesn't work. This failure of promotion is the interesting factor, not the conceptualization of an idealization as separate model. While this conceptualization is interesting to talk about, it is not what is at stake, and Norton's distinction has done some harm in this regard.\n"}],"additions":6,"deletions":13},{"filepath":"20210119144549-categorization_of_idealizations.org","oid":"44a5181c81b9d00a99ea59713f33910cce553bf7","diff":[{"count":49,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       3c3b33a1-b8db-4be9-8acc-244cc7230172\n:END:\n#+title: Categorization of idealizations\n#+filetags: thesis distinction idealizations\n\nNicer version [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"infinite_idealizations_chapter.org"},{"count":9,"added":true,"value":"1fbefa5c-d5a1-4061-a043-e7c2ffd7c596"},{"count":1861,"value":"][small sample on infinite vs normal idealization]]\n* Good distinciton\n\nI want to find a way to distinguish between all the ways people distinguish between idealizations, because there are too damn many.\n** Idealization\nSome model that's (intentionally) false in some respect\n*** Simple\nAn idealization which is achieved by setting a paramater to a certain value, such as zero.\n- Frictionless plane\n\n  They are direct and unproblematic.\n*** Infinite\nAn idealization which is made by doing some sort of limiting operation such that a parameter goes to zero or infinity\nIt's rarely just \"one\" model but often some sort of sequence of models considered as a whole.

We can imagine that the surface/volume ratio of an infinite sphere is 1/r, but an infinite sphere does not exist\n  - FQHE: 2D electrons do not exist\n  - TDL: there are no infinite molecules, nor are molecules infinitely small\n  - AB effect: there are no infinite solenoids\n  - Population drift: there are no infinite populations\n\n+ Problems\n  - It is difficult to see what exactly \"the limit system does not exist\" means. Norton was relatively clear on that, but other authors have been less clear.\n******* Contradiction in terms (analytic)\nHere the problem arises because an infinitely small or big process/entity/model cannot exist per the definition of the thing. A sphere is defined by the equidistant points from a center, but points infinitely far away cannot meaningfully be said to be equidistant. Or points infinitely far away aren't points? Whatever.\n\nThis requires us to be quite strict with our definitions, something which physical models rarely are.\n******* Contradiction somewhere else, usually physical (synthetic)\n\nHere the problem arises not because the stipulated entity could not be imagined with a property set to zero or infinity, but because this would contradict something else. I feel like most problems discussed of actual idealizations used in physics are of this kind, as they seem to contradict something uncontrovertible.\n\nAs cite:Shech2013 points out, for this to work you also need to stipulate that the idealization is real in some sense in order to force a strong contradiction. One way to do this is by using an indispensability argument.\n\n+ Examples\n  - FQHE: problem is that actual electrons are not 2D\n  - AB: problem is that actual solenoids are not infinite\n  - TDL: problem is that actual systems do not contain infinite amounts of molecules\n  - Population drift: problem is that actual populations cannot be infinite, because too many?\n\nIf feel like we can distinguish /even further/ here, namely between idealizations which set a value to infinity vs those that set a value to zero. Maybe this is a higher category, but I feel like the ones that set stuff to zero could have a chance of not being physically problematic, because we can imagine that property not being there. That would then be either above or below existence mismatch, or above problematic maybe. However this would just move the categorty of problematic lower.\n\nBut, some things can get set to zero and cause a problem, such as FQHE where 3D dimension is set to zero. So then it would be indirect->zero -> nonproblem/problem -> existence mismatch whatever\n****** Discontinuous limit\nProblematic indirect infinite idealization where the promotion fails because the infinite limit does make sense (in some way) but that there is a dicontinuous jump in the property that is indirectly affected\n+ Examples\n  - Longer and longer ellipsoid becomes an infinitely long cylinder, but an infinitely long cylinder has a different surface to volume ratio than any of the ellipsoids.\n  - Thermodynamic heat transfer/reversible process.\n    A reversible process is an idealization of an infinitely slow process such that the system stays in equilibrium all the time. As the \"heat transfer time interval\" goes to zero all is well, but at 0 no heat can be transfered. Here an arbitrarily slow process works, but an infinitely slow one does not.\n"}],"additions":2,"deletions":2},{"filepath":"20210204155921-if_you_cant_loop_back_to_your_introduction_make_shit_up_in_your_conclusion.org","oid":"e7ef71dbcd7b0580d80a0b7058eac77a9de0b2c4","diff":[{"count":103,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       f5e4542f-0c24-4f50-bdfc-5e6d39ab8001\n:END:\n#+title: if you cant loop back to your introduction, make shit up in your conclusion\n#+filetags: writing thesis\n\n* Context\n\nHad a chat with Guido and Ronnie about my thesis, where we discussed my introduction ([["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"Introduction.org"},{"count":9,"added":true,"value":"fc0a61f3-2c05-4c30-ac48-08b84203010a"},{"count":321,"value":"][Proselike introduction v1]]).

Crucially, one rather popular explanation of the FQHE necessarily employs an infinitesimal idealization, namely that the configuration space of the electrons involved is 2D. The configuration space of electrons is always 3D, so this is a classic example of an idealization as a fiction used to explain something. However, contra cite:Strevens2019a, I argue that this idealization cannot be construed as one which gets rid of a variable irrelevant to the explanation, as this infinite idealization is /crucial/ to the whole explanation: without it there is no explanation.\n\nBut, I am getting ahead of myself. The FQHE is not easily summarized in a short paragraph, and the rest of this chapter will be dedicated to providing a rudimentary understanding of the effect and its \"causes\".\n\n\n** The [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210218152105"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"8fc72829"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"classical_hall_effect.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"7ad9-4c8a-b400-229add0957bb"},{"count":1440,"value":"][classical hall effect]]\n\nBefore we start to describe the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, we should first understand Quantum Hall effects more generally. To do /that/, a short description of the classical Hall Effect is in order.\n\nThe classical Hall effect can be briefly described as the measurement of a voltage /across/ (transversally) a thin conducting plate trough which a current is run in the longitudinal direction and which is subject to a magnetic field perpendicular to both, as in Figure \\ref{fig:che}\n\n#+caption: set up of the che, stolen from cite:Shech2019\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:che\n[[./media/che.png]]\n\nClassically, we can explain the observation of this voltage by the fact that the electrons travelling in the longitudinal direction experience a Lorentz force $\\textbf{F} = q\\textbf{E} + q\\textbf{v} \\times \\textbf{B}$, which causes them to be redirected to one of the sides of the plate. This leads to a gradient of electrons along the transversal axis, i.e. a voltage difference. Instead of a voltage, the resistance is usually measured.\n\nThe classical Hall effect is relatively well understood and, frankly, quite boring.\n\nThe classical quantum hall effect happens around .......\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect(s)\n:LOGBOOK:\nCLOCK: [2021-03-09 Tue 09:51]\n:END:\n\nThings start to get more interesting once the strength of the magnetic field is increased quite a bit. We start to observe plateaux at regular intervals in the transversal resistance.\n#+caption: qhe\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe.png]]\n\nWe would of course like to know what explains the appearance of these plateaux.\n\nAt even stronger magnetic fields and even cleaner samples, we start to see even more plateaux.\n\n\n...\n\nLet us first focus our attention on the lower magnetic field range, which gives rise to the socalled /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/. First observed in XXXX by YY, the effect gets its name from the plateaux appearing at integer multiples of the \"quantum of resistance\".\n\n** Quantum of Resistance\n\n\\[R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi\\]\n\n\nThis is strange, as from the classical quantum hall effect we expect the transversal resistance to vary linearly with the strength of the magnetic field.\n\n** Landau levels\n\nThe IQHE comes from the impurities present in the sample: the \"pure\" energy eigenstates of the system would not lead plateaux. The impurities can be modeled as a random potential. This random potential breaks the degeneracy of the Landau levels and \"smooths them out\", like\n#+caption: smooth landau, stolen from Tong.\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:nondegenlandau\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\nIn addition, the disorder causes the energy levels to be split up into /extended/ and /localized/ energy states, like\n#+caption: extended v localized, also Tong\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended v localized\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nOnly the extended energy levels carry current, the localized ones do not. Furthermore, the extended ones are favored? In any case, as the magnetic field strength increases, so does the energy of the states, so they get pushed up to a new energy level. However, they first have to fill the localized states before they are able to reach a new extended state, and all these localized states do not conduct i.e. do not contribute to the conductivity i.e. do not change the resistance of the material. Tada, you got plateaux.\n\nAt this point one may have some questions: these extended states sound like they are about the longitudinal resistance, not the transversal. Furthermore, if the extended states gets less populated and the localized states more populated over the course of a plateaux, why does the resistivity not just shoot up since there are so many less conductive states?\n\nThe answer to the latter is that the extended states will end up conducting more, somehow.\n"}],"additions":3,"deletions":3},{"filepath":"20210309112810-infinite_idealizations_resemble_sorites_because_both_have_discontinuous_transitions.org","oid":"e0fcb20830d9a35aa86bf4def63bc01e2d225b48","diff":[{"count":78,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       37bfaecb-92e6-4cd7-9735-2b6c940c0e03\n:END:\n#+title: Infinite idealizations resemble Sorites because both have discontinuous transitions\n#+filetags: vagueness central thesis\n\n\n* Context\n\nMy thesis heavily centers around two topics: [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20201219152020"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"4d1d4b14"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"infinite_idealizations.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"fb53-41d2-bc0d-a1c197cc6df0"},{"count":12,"value":"][infinite idealizations]] and [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210114163906"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"2bd50b77"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"vagueness.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"d226-4853-8bf2-d0e69b570a53"},{"count":8,"value":"][vagueness]]/[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210309112947"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"207301aa"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"sorites_paradox.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"718d-417a-b3c0-103264d7a88f"},{"count":74,"value":"][sorites paradox]].

Is there even a good explanation there?\n*** [ ] In how much details should I treat non-abelian anyons?\n* The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n** Part I (Brief, <4k): The motivation for looking at the FQHE gets explained, namely the fact that something appears to be explained with an infinite idealization, with reference to my introduction and Shech's article,\n\n*** a. /b/ The FQHE is briefly introduced, namely the weird bumps and a hint of mentioning anyons and that the reason for this is that the config space is 2D\n\n\n*** b. /a/ This 2D explanation is identified as an infinitesimal idealization, one which has been claimed to play a key role in the /explanation/ of the effect, and explanation => existence. It should be clear how weirdly different this explanation is from other more common ones, such as classical ones. Also it should be emphasized how universal this explanation is, such as the fact that the location of the bumps does not even depend on the material.\n\n\n*** c. It is argued that if this explanation would succeed in the way described above, we would have a reasonable case for an actual sectioning off of reality? Here it must be clear why this effect is so useful to study, but also what I will do when it does not turn out to be so dramatic, i.e. how I will generalize\n\n** Part II (Long, ~10k): The details of the FQHE are laid bare, with little interpretation going on in order for the actual \"explanation\" of the effect to be as clear as possible, mostly based on Tong\n\n*** d. The groundwork needed for the explanation to get things of the ground is laid: the CHE is explained in more detail, Landau levels are introduced and the distinction between the Integer and Fractional QHE is clarified, and the former is (for now) made clear to be less important to explain\n\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n*****  To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field.

What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n...\n\n**** Quantization\n\n***** The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it.

This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\n***** An additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210223162026"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"c1a2779f"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"the_dimensions_of_the_hall_system_is_set_to_2_from_the_start.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"73d4-491e-8d7b-02f04dd20776"},{"count":933,"value":"][The dimensions of the Hall system is set to 2 from the start]]\n\n\n*** e. The FQHE is set up in more detail, with the goal of making clear which idealizing assumptions are made, such as the LWF, the plasma analogy and why the toy model is needed. It is again emphasized that the FQHE is explained more in a \"making plausible\" way rather than a \"derivation way\", and seeds are planted as to what this will imply for the kind of explanation (not DN) under study\n\n**** Dawdling\n***** Now that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n\n***** I don't want to look at the IQHE too much, as while it is interesting, its explanation does not require nearly the same idealizations as its fractional counterpart.\n\n***** However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n***** There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\n****** The Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n****** The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n\n***** For those reasons we will be skipping a thorough examination of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect and jump straight into the FQHE\n\n**** FQHE\n\n***** The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n****** Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer Counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same ~ballpark~ solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\n****** It would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n- [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210309164800"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"2517c712"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"the_wavefunction_of_the_fqhe_is_guessed_from_general_grounds.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"c625-4cd3-9d8e-93b37baeeac6"},{"count":28,"value":"][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n- [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210311184105"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"39621947"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"the_fqh_state_is_interpreted_as_a_plasma_to_allow_for_intuitions.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"ed87-43ad-86d6-14a5e4f2b8c2"},{"count":113,"value":"][The FQH State Is Interpreted as a Plasma to Allow for Intuitions and Computation]]\n- The LWF is not even an actual ground state of the FQH Hamiltonian, instead from it we derive a Toy Hamiltonian of which the LWF is the ground state, bringing us even further from our goal.\n\n-[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210319113940"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"23e0cf04"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"fractional_statistics_can_only_be_calculated_using_adiabaticity.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"bd7f-4c24-bdd0-7f65dea6df6b"},{"count":343,"value":"][Fractional Statistics can Only be Calculated Using Adiabaticity]]\n****** Using these assumptions/idealizations however, we can make it plausible that FQ statistics are happening, I don't think we will use much more.\n\n****** The wavefunction under consideration is called the Laughlin Wave Function, thought up by >>Laughlin in 1983 after the experimental observation of the FQHE in 1982 by ...\n\n****** Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named \"anyons\".\n\nA particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.\n\n** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space\n\nHow do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?\nWe have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.\n\nAs mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.\n\nUsing the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.\n\n** Naive exchange\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):\n\nWe start out with a wavefunction $\\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_1\\psi_2\\]\n\nIf we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210210115635"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"4b10bcb4"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"phase_transitions.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"8337-4b3e-be7a-adab788f995c"},{"count":3812,"value":"][phase transitions]]\n\n\\[\\Psi_\\pi=e^{i\\theta\\pi}\\psi_2\\psi_1\\]\n\nExchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with\n\n\\[\\Psi_{2\\pi}=e^{i2\\pi\\theta}\\Psi_0\\]\n\nTherefore, $e^{i2\\pi\\theta}=1 \\rightarrow e^{i\\pi\\theta}=\\pm 1$, which leads to $\\theta=0 \\lor \\theta=1$.\n\nWe have therefore \"shown\" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\\theta=0$) and fermions ($\\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.\n\n** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not \"the operator framework\" )\n\nWhat we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.\n\n(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)\n\nThe three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation\n\n\\begin{equation}\n[S_i,S_j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K\n    \\label{eq:spincomm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nIf we take the state $\\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^2\\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:spinsquared}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\nS_3\\ket{s,m}=m\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:s3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nthen we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^+\\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\\ket{s,m+1}=\\ket{s,m'}\n    \\label{eq:splus}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf we require $\\sqrt{|\\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\ns(s+1)-m(m+1)\\geq0 \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:posnorm}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq s \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:ms}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIt is clear then, that for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so\n\\begin{equation}\ns-m= n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:int}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimilarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s=n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:mpluss}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining \\eqref{eq:int} and \\eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s+s-m=2s=n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow s=\\frac{n}{2}\n    \\label{eq:proofofinteger}\n\\end{equation}\nSince $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.\n\nSo, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.\n\n*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng\n\n*** TODO Spin statistics relation\n\n\n** Configuration space framework\n\nThe above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.\n\nLuckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows\n\n1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles\n2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space\n3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange\n\nIt almost seems too easy.\n\nLet's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).\n\nWithout any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d\\]\n\nHowever, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.\n\n\n\nWe need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )\n\nLet us call the set of diagonal points $\\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\\mathbf{r}=(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})$.\n\n\nThen, for our configuration space looks like\n\\begin{equation}\nQ= \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d  - \\Delta }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:confspaceddim}\n\\end{equation}\n\n# =just blantantly copied=\nIn order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can \"discard\" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in\n\\begin{equation}\nS=\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d -\\Delta}{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:S}\n\\end{equation}\n\nBefore showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....\n\n*** 3D\nLet's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\\Delta$, which for $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1 -\\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).\n\n[[./media/3dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\n\n=Copying again=\n\nAn exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be \"looping it around\" the sphere (path C).\n\nWhat is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.\n\nNow we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha^2=+1 \\rightarrow \\alpha = \\pm 1\n    \\label{eq:doubleexchange}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.\n\n\n*** 2D\n\nLet us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.\n\n[[./media/2dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 2D exchange\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\nWe make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.\n\nHowever, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the \"string\" cannot collapse to single point in principle.\n\nTherefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\\alpha$ has no effect on $|\\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}\n    \\label{eq:phasephase}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n*** Connection to the Braid group\n\nThe above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210403183452"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"2e0a3a59"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"simply_connected.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"3794-4b5f-8313-f630d88a7a87"},{"count":66,"value":"][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way?

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210218153430"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"69945ee0"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"fermions.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"4f04-419b-8680-e45203302491"},{"count":24,"value":"][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210218153456"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"edcab4d4"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"bosons.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"3171-4b32-9833-451bfc53bafa"},{"count":218,"value":"][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210223152109"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"c2ab82ac"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"spin.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"8f25-4f9e-aabe-9fe53484c1d3"},{"count":199,"value":"][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210218152909"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"31cd49eb"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"anyons.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"770f-4d11-98b2-ca666b534201"},{"count":1630,"value":"][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\nThis might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n** 1.4 Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\nWhile this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n\\]\nIf we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n. However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\nNow, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\nTo get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection.

Therefore, since small 3D is not approximately 2D, the 2D idealization is truly indispensible to our explanation of the emergence of anyons and we therefore ought to take it ontologically seriously.\n\nNow that we have finally grasped the core of Shech's argument, we are at last able to push back a little. At the end of this chapter, I will have shown how to fully make sense of the emergence of anyons in the quantum Hall system without relying on the 2D idealization. Before that however, I want to make it at least somewhat plausible that this /can/ be done.\n\nTo start, as we have seen above, to derive the existence of anyons, i.e. particles whose phase under exchange $\\neq 0,1$ , we do not necessarily require the configuration space to be $2D$, but merely for said configuration space to be non-[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210403183452"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"2e0a3a59"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"simply_connected.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"3794-4b5f-8313-f630d88a7a87"},{"count":1712,"value":"][Simply connected]]. Therefore, it seems plausible that an approximate 3D explanation could get off the ground, if only we can show that it is non-simply connected. The rest of the chapter serves as that argument.\n\n** First steps\n\nTo gain some confidence in the idea, let us  prove that an idealized /3D/  configuration space can also be non-simply connected. The key reason why the 3D configuration space constructed previously is necessarily simply connected is due to the fact that we 'merely' have a zero-dimensional hole at the origin where the two particles would intersect, which, since we also want to describe fermions, is forbidden by the Pauli-exclusion principle.[fn:1]  According to our current best scientific theories, fermions (and presumably the anyons under question as well) are understood best as point-particles, and thus the intersection being a single point in configuration space seems to be justified. I claim, however, that if this condition would be relaxed, allowing for a larger \"forbidden\" space, then,  in conjunction with two other plausible premises, we arrive at a multiply connected 3D configuration space. If this sounds rather ad-hoc, that is because it is. The final argument will not rely on these assumptions, so for now I believe they cause little harm. although I will attempt some minor justification at the end of this section.\n\nThe main idea is the following: if the minimum distance between the particles is greater then the \"height\" of the configuration space (here the size of the QH system), the 3d configuration space becomes multiply connected as well, as there are no paths which will \"loop over\" the singularity points. Imagine a box with a billiard ball in the middle which pokes out of the top and bottom, this is a reasonable model for now for the possible configurations of the particles.\n\nTo construct this configuration space we require three conditions on top of the ones already mentioned before ($(\\mathbf{r_1}, \\mathbf{r_2})=(\\mathbf{r_2, r_1})$ and $|r|\\neq 0$)\n1. $\\Psi(r_i\\geq b_i)=0$ where $b_i \\quad i=x,y,z$ are the dimensions of the quantum Hall system. This says: the probability of finding the particle outside the quantum Hall system is $0$, which is not exactly true but for now works as a useful assumption, modeling the boundaries of the system as an infinite potential well\n2. $\\Psi(|r|\\leq a)=0$, where $a$ is some real number representing the minimum allowed distance between the two particles\n3. $b_x, b_y\\geq a \\geq b_z$ (or really any of the dimensions, it just needs to be )\n\nBoth of these will be argued for in more detail below, but for now I claim that /if/ $\\exists a\\geq \\beta\\in \\mathbb{R} \\quad \\Psi(r\\leq a)=0$, where \\beta is the height of the fractional quantum Hall system and \\alpha the minimum distance allowed between the two particles, then the resulting configuration space will be non-simply connected.\n\nTo briefly sketch an intuitive picture, let us recall our $d$-dimensional configuration space @@latex: \\eqref{confspaceddim} @@ and the fact that we are only really interested in the latter half of that configuration space, as the absolute position of the particles (e.g. the location of the quantum Hall system) should not really matter. So we are just looking at the paths in\n\\[S=\\frac{\\mathbb{R} ^3-\\Delta }{Z_2} \\]\n\nNow we add our conditions above. 2) creates a sphere of forbidden particle positions around the origin (where the particles are near one another), which we can model as subtracting those a sphere of radius $\\alpha$, called  $\\sigma$, from the configuration space. Since \\sigma encompasses the points \\Delta, we can leave out \\Delta. Additionally,  1) means we are excising the points outside of the QH system, which I will represent with $\\beta$ , which are the points ranging from $[-\\frac{b_i}{2},+\\frac{b_i}{2}] \\quad i=x,y,z$ .[fn:2] Thus creating our new configuration space for $2$ particles\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tilde{Q}'= \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^{3} -\\sigma -\\beta  }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:goodconf}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhich can be crudely represented as\n[[./media/ballspace.png]]\n#+caption: Exaggerated representation of $\\tilde{Q}'$\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ballspace\n\n*** \"Proof\"\n$\\tilde{Q}'$ is clearly non-simply connected, as there are loops that can be formed around the center of the space which cannot possibly be deformed into a point.

These don't follow from each other directly, but since the homotopy classes of both are identical I don't see much need to illustrate this in much detail})\n\nA rigorous derivation of the fundamental group of these spaces is highly non-trivial (see for instance cite:Fox1962 for the derivation of the 2D case). I will instead do the normal philospher of physics thing, namely to gesture at a proof which I belief will probably hold.\n\nThe only thing we need to show is that the $3D$ case is not different in any relevant  respect to the $2D$ one. In case of the fundamental group, the relevant respect is the number of [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210427162825"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"896697ec"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"homotopy_equivalent_paths.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"2e29-446e-9caf-7919b3639bdb"},{"count":1131,"value":"][Homotopy equivalent paths]], the classes of paths which cannot be continuously deformed into one another. In a non-simply connected space, a path which winds around a \"hole\" cannot continuously be deformed into one which does not, nor can a path which winds around said hole twice be deformed into one that only winds around it once, or winds around it twice clockwise.\n\nLuckily for us, the  homotopy equivalent paths of  $\\tilde{Q}'$ are the same as those for $\\tilde{Q}$ , as all the paths that wind around the \"origin-hole\"  $k$ times can be continuously deformed into one another in both cases, and no other winding-sites exist. If our space would have additional holes, that could pose a problem, but for now we can rest easy.\n\nThus, since the number of homotopy classes is the same, the fundamental group is also identical, namely $B_N$ for $N$ particles. Therefore the $1D$ rep will remain the same, and the particles will not be limited to a phase of $0$  or $1$, and therefore anyons are possible.\n\n\n** Justifying the conditions\nWhile I will give some justification below, let us consider one line of argument: since (presumably) the configuration space just constructed allows for the existence of anyons, why do we not simply discard our previous idealization and insert this one into the EIA? Sure, it has some quirks, but the condition that particles cannot come within a certain distance of one another is hardly more problematic than assuming the particles cannot move in an entire dimension. The additional criterion of the wavefunction being zero outside the QH system similarly appears less restrictive than the 2D idealization. Can we then just assume that this is a strictly better model to use?\n\nUnfortunately, not quite. While assumptions 1. and 2. might be brushed off in this way, accepting 3. without further justification =is not nice=. Unlike the /2D/ idealization, performing an inference to the best explanation also does not appear quite satisfactory, as the condition is so specific that unjustified acceptance makes it ~too ad hoc~.\n\n*(My idea for justifying this was to find a way to express the probability of finding the particle in the z direction and contrast that with the Coulomb force, but I wasn't able to find the former. Shech cites a $10^{-45}$  probability for it, but he doesn't justify or cite it. In the end it does not really matter as this is just a proof of concept, but would be nice to have)*\n\n# The AB effect also has such a strong idealization. Underscription of idealizations.\n\n* Footnotes\n[fn:2] It's /2 in order to have the origin be set at zero.\n\n[fn:1] Unless further argued for, this statement is technically begging the question, as the Pauli-exclusion principle is a consequence of the phases being a certain way and probably should not be assumed. There exist less ad-hoc ways of formalizing this constraint, which, however, do often rely on specific interpretations of quantum mechanics, see for instance

We will look at an example\n\n* The Cone Example and Holonomy\n\n  The initial way of calculating the Berry phase shows that we still get a discontinuous jump, which is bad. Here we will see that sometimes this can be removed, by looking at the parallel transport of a vector around a cone.\n\n  Parallel transport is a bit strange. On a flat Euclidean plane, nothing happens.\n  A cone is like a flat Euclidean plane glued together in a weird way, like this\n\n[[./media/conefold.png]]\n\nWhere side $s$ is glued to side $?$ in order to yield a smooth surface, with the exception of the problematic point $S$.\n\nWe can then calculate our parallel transport by simply \"doing\" the parallel transport on the surface of the \"flat\" cone.\n\nThe vector is transport from the one side to the other, eventually reaching the edge $s$, from where it is suddenly teleported to $s$, ending up with a much different angle.\n\n[[./media/transport.jpeg]]\nhttps://www.physicsforums.com/threads/parallel-transport-and-cone.1000209/\n\n\nThis angle difference is directly related to the angle of the cone. We see that the sharper the cone, the bigger the failure of parallel transport (holonomy) will be.\n\nThe strange thing is, of course, that this angle difference appears rather suddenly only after we completed >1 round. However, were we to move an 'actual' vector on a cone, we'd expect this to happen slowly, right? We want to get rid of the \"discontinuous jump\".\n\nThis question proves rather difficult to answer, for two reasons.\n1. The holonomic angle is only defined when the vector returns to its original position, we don't expect thing to be the same when we simply stop the transport somewhere in the middle.\n2. Actual cones are not this pointy.\n\nhttp://applet-magic.com/paralleltransport.htm\n\nIn actuality, when you deform the cone in the figure above, the angle /does/ change continuously along the path of the cone wrt beginning angle, but that's very often the case and does not count.\n\nInstead of having the continuous parameter be the angle of the cone, a better one would be the \"path\", since we are interested in paths after all. Here we see that if we take any path that does not cross the \"seam\", the angle remains 0. But the seam is kind of arbitrary, so that is not really fair.\nWe do know, however, that if the path encircles the tip of the cone it definitely passes the seam. So now we have our discontinuity: all paths that do not cross the tip do not gain a holomorphic angle (because those paths are the same as paths in Euclidean spacetime), while as soon as the path encompasses the origin it has to cross the seam and thus gains an angle $\\phi$.\n\nSince this failure of parallel transport is a geometric property, we say that all the geometric information of the cone is centered in one point, because inclusion of that point in the path makes or breaks the angle.\n\n** Less pointy cone\n\n\n   As we see, the thing we then need to change in order to get a more smooth cone holonomy is the tip. At the moment we have only one point which is problematic. This can be seen as our idealization: an infinitely sharp cone instead of a blunt one.\n\n   When we blunt the cone, we suddenly see that the path can be continuously deformed to include the \"seam\". However, what we have gained in smoothness we have lost in mathematical simplicity: we no longer can easily relate the cone to the Euclidean plane. In order to describe the blunt cone, we need to describe it's /connection/ and do some differential geometry.\n\n   ...\n\n   Now we see that the cone is good.\n\n* Relating this back to anyons\n\n  The case with anyons is similar: we calculate the geometric phase using the fact that the space has one anomolous point, namely the spot where the other particle is. How do we go about making this less problematic?\n\n cite:Ong2006 gives an explanation of things.\n\n\n\n=COPY PASTE TONGS EXPLANATION IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER LIKE SHAHIN SUGGESTED=\n"}],"additions":3,"deletions":3},{"filepath":"20210525170640-overdescription_gauge_cover_ing_space.org","oid":"587b9223b4e7da32c35c205f71b834d0bdd896fa","diff":[{"count":89,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       0f439030-4c44-4c62-88a1-eca8e027a3da\n:END:\n#+title: Underdescription = gauge = cover(ing space)\n#+filetags: physics mathematics gauge philosophy\n\n* Underdescription = gauge = cover(ing space)\n\nWhat philosophers call \"underdescription\", physicists call [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210223165813"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"fab92aca"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"gauge_freedom.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"8392-49e1-8c66-922fc37d77a1"},{"count":23,"value":"][gauge freedom]], and mathematicians (roughly) call a [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210516212245"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"32d4f910"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"cover.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"5305-4e22-886f-5f823172aca3"},{"count":163,"value":"][Cover]]: they all describe a larger space which maps onto a smaller space which we actually care about.\n\nThis is not completely fair, as underdescription is the most general, gauge is more specific and cover is super specific.\n\nBut it works: a theory which underdescribes phenomena can map onto several more specific theories, a theory with a gauge freedom map onto several specific theories, and a space can be a cover for several spaces.\n"}],"additions":6,"deletions":6},{"filepath":"20210528160149-outline_anyons.tmp6aVMYQ.org","oid":"ce19cf1f9692d4ffa05133331f10f915d7fb91b6","diff":[{"count":5975,"value":"# Created 2021-06-07 Mon 22:59\n:PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       273c7d2a-e23c-4991-b680-6af3cb1d9162\n:END:\n#+TITLE: Outline Anyons bad\n#+AUTHOR: Thomas F.

However, many things are postulated in physics and never realized, so just being an idealization does not make it intersitng.\n   However, anyons are claimed to be observed [@Bartolomei2020]. How then do we square this?\n\n\nSome, like [@Shech2019], go even further and claim that these kinds of observations give indirect evidence for Platonism, making anyons even more intersting to look at.\n\nThe standard explanation of anyons is inherently /topological/. Topological explanation share something inherently in common with idealizations, and are thus extra worth looking at.\n\nWe can't directly talk about the failure of any particular idealization, only about a certain property. Anyons are interesting because the property is existence.\n\n\nHowever, to properly understand anyons, we need to look at the actual systems from which they come, which are things that look like the quantum hall effect. Otherwise we are simply examining the idealization on its own, rather than seeing whether the idealization corresponds to reality in any way (super-symmetry etc). Therefore, we should look at the FQHE to properly evaluate the status of anyons.\n\nFrom examining this, we see that the phase does not arise topologically in the description of the quantum hall effect (as you cannot really calculate things with that) but /geometrically/. Thus we will need to examine how geometric phase works and whether and how this could be related to the topology.\n\nThis discussion will then offer some inspiration for how such topological questions should be thought of.\n- Topological explanations are not uncommon in physics, example?.\n\n** New intro\n\n=Good line to introduce the chapter=\n\n\nThe main subject of discussion here will be a new class of (quasi-)particles: anyons. In undergraduate courses, or, if you're lucky, highschool, we learn that two types of particles exist: fermions and bosons. These particles are distinguished by spin, half-integer and integer spin respectively. Anyons, as their name suggests, break this binary and are allowed /any/ type of spin, creating a whole new category of particle.[fn:4] While anyons are fascinating in their own right, we are interested in them because, according to the canon explanation, anyons are two-dimensional particles. More suggestively, the space they occupy cannot be /approximately/ $2D$, such as a $3D$ space of $1nm$ height, but /exactly/ two dimensional: a clear case of an infinite(simal) idealization. Of course, anyons would be just another plaything, were it not that, at the time of writing, anyons have rather strong empirical backing [@Bartolomei2020].\n\n\nAnother reason why anyons present such an interesting case, is that their explanation explicitly requires /topological/ arguments. Topological arguments, as I will show, show up in unexpected places and allow problematic idealizations to sneak in, as they smooth out many of the difficult to solve geometry. By tackling such an explicit use of topology in an infinite idealization, we will be able to use the argumentative structure in our general analysis of infinite idealizations. =The opposite of topology is geometry=\n\n*************** TODO this is a new task tallyho\n*************** END\n\n\n[fn:4] Or an infinite number of new particle types, depending on one's preference.\n\n\n\n* Topology and Anyons\n\nIn a standard physics undergraduate program, you learn that there are two types of particles, fermions and bosons, which are distinguished by their spin, fermions coming in half-integer multiples $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} , ... )$ and bosons in integer multiples $(0, 1, 2, ...)$. A good starting question for understanding anyons would be: why /do/ we think there are only two types of particles? Why not $1$, or $3$, or infintely many? While many similar questions are as of yet unanswerable, such as why there appear to be only three generations of leptons (e.g. electrons, muons, tauons) or three fundamental forces in the standard model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), this one does have an accepted answer. It is, as always, a combination of experimental results and theory. Fermions and bosons' share few features besides the fact that they are particles, but the important commonality is that they are both /indistinguishable/ particles. Every electron is the exact same as every other electron, and every photon is perfectly identical to the next. There is no way to tell whether two fermions or two bosons have switched places when you weren't looking. We will explore the consequences of this in more detail later, but the important consequence of this fact is that it induces an overdescription of the physical situation: we can mathematically describe two situations, one in which we have electron $1$ on the left and electron $2$ on the left. While mathematically distinct, these situations are physically identical, and in order for our physics to make sense we need to account for this distinction. The reasons for assuming indistinguishability could be a thesis topic in its own right, and the above description does not attempt to do it justice. The important point is /how/ we arrive from this indistinguishability to the fact that there are two types of particles: how does indistinguishability help us distinguish particles, and how do we mathematically distinguish these identical states?\n\nAs a warm-up, let us consider a rather handwavey argument. Handwavey, because it relies on the particles still being distinguishable, but it illustrates the point. Say we start with a system $\\Psi_0$ of two particles, $x_1$ and $x_2$, each with their own probability distribution $\\psi_i$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)\\]\nNow, for our next trick, we will exchange the two particles, such that particle $x_1$ is in state $\\psi_a$ and particle $x_2$ is in state $\\psi_b$. If we suggestively take state $\\psi_i$ to be mean something like \"having probability $1$ of being found around $x=a$\", then this exchange can be the physical exchange of the two particles. Now, of course, we do not know which particle is which, so writing down the 1-exchange wave function would be getting ahead of ourselves, but we do know that if we were to exchange the particles once again we should regain our initial wavefunction $\\Psi_0$. To dentote this, we define an exchange operator $P$ which does just, and say that the wavefunction after exchanging twice (= rotating by 360 degrees) is $\\psi_{2\\pi}=P^2\\psi_0=1\\psi_0$. To find the wavefunction of the 1-exchang system, we find\n\\[\\psi_{\\pi}=P\\psi_0=\\sqrt{1}\\psi_0=\\pm 1\\psi_0\\]\n\nThis yields two possibilities for particles: those for with $P=-1$ and those for which $P=1$. The latter are bosons and the former are fermions.[fn:7]\n\n\n\n\nThe above argument is too handwavey, so we would like to make it more concrete. The way to define what we mean by \"exchange/ability/\". To start, the suggestively italicized /ability/ part of exchangeability hints at the fact that the /possible/ ways a particle /is able to be/ exchanged is of central importance. One natural way of defining this is by looking at all the possible paths the particle can take. We would need to look at the /configuration space/ of the particles: the possible configurations of them and connections between these configurations.[fn:8] Now we need to supplant this with a notion of what it means for two paths to be /the same/, or, equivalently, what it means for two paths to be different. This idea of path-similarity depends on which factors we judge relevant when considering manipulating quantum particles, which we need to choose if we wish to obtain the most general description possible. Like most of physics, we would not want our description to depend on some sort of absolute position or orientation in space, so our description better ignore those. Beyond that, however, identifying the relevant factors of the space becomes more tricky. The two most promising candidates are a /geometric/ or /topological/ notion of path similarity. As it turns out, the latter is used in the most commonly accepted explanation of anyons, the main reason being the mathematical and conceptual simplicity it brings.\n\nThe main notion of similarity used to explain anyons, namely the topological notion of /homotopy equivalence/, roughly means that two paths are the same if they can be continuously deformed into one another. This differs wildly from /geometric/ path equivalence: there paths are only \"the same\" if they traverse the same path in the same space, they need to be =isomorphic=. Consider the difference between a mountain ridge versus a nice meadow. Geometrically, the two are very different, and if we were to care about how exhausting a hike over that distance would be we would certainly not neglect to take those differences into consideration. On the other hand, if we were an amateur nautical cartographer interested in plotting out all bodies of water in the area, we would consider both spaces identically topologically: neither of them has any lakes. It is clear why a topological approach to particle paths would be attractive, as it massively simplifies the set of possibilities down to the bare essentials. It is clear that sometimes we do need to consider the relevant geometry however: our hiker will no doubt complain if their map-making friend confuses meadows for mountains, or vice versa depending on their constitution.\n\nReturning to anyons, we see that the approach taken for the /explanation/ turns out to be topological, while when actually calculating the phase we need to take into account the /geometry/. Here we will first discuss the topological argument, after which we will consider the prequisites for and the geometrical argument itself in Section 3 and 4.\n\nBy focussing on the homotopy notion of equivalent paths, we release ourselves from the burden of having to examine each individual path and instead are able to focus on features of the /space/. Specifically, since we only need whether two paths are continuously deformed into one another, we just need to look at whether the space allows for such trickyness. This feature of a space is called its *connectedness*. A space is called *simply connected* iff all /loops/ can be deformed into a point, like in figure ref:fig:connectedness. For our purposes, since we are looking at the position of a particle in spacetime, we can consider a space to be simply connected if it has no holes. Here a hole is a hole that \"pierces\" the space: the handle in the \"space\" of a coffeecup and the hole in the \"space\" of a donut are prime examples, while the inside of a bottle or a bubble in a glass of coke do not count as \"holes\" for the sake of connectedness. On the contrary, spaces with such holes are called /multiply-connected/, or sometimes more simply /non-simply-connected/ spaces.\n\nThis concept of connectedness allows us to understand the main assumption behind the handwavey argument above: we return to the same position after rotating 2\\pi if the space is simply connected, because \"being the same\" means \"being the same path\" and \"being the same path\" means \"being able to continuously deform them to each other\" and \"doing nothing\" is the \"point path\" and you are only able to shrink all paths to a point in a simply connected space. This, of course, raises the question: is the configuration space of two identical particles always simply connected, i.e., why do should we return to the same system after rotating $2\\pi$? As we will see, it is simply connected in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but /not/ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is why people say that anyons can only exist in 2D. As we will also see, however, is that this is not strictly true, as we can conceive of somewhat plausible multiply-connected 3D spaces.\n\n[fn:7] Note that this does not directly follow: it could also be the case that particles just sometimes have -1 and other times +1. Empirically, however, we find no such distinction, only dependent on particle type.\n\n[fn:8] The other framework for considering such exchange is in terms of exchanging all the relevant quantum numbers, effectively mathematically swapping the particles. We shall see that this does not work for defining anyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Phase\n\nMuch of the upcoming section will be centered around calculating the /phase/ of a quantum system, and it will be useful to briefly go over what we mean by phase and its relation to anyons. Briefly stated, the phase factor is a complex number which does not change the physical information if applied globally, that is when multiplying every wavefunction under consideration with it. The $\\pm1$ applied by our operator $P$ is such a phase.\nPhase arises because the empirical outcome of measuring a quantum state involves calculating the modulo-squared of the wavefunction. There are simply (at least) two wavefunctions which arrive at the same outcome if you square them with their complex conjugate: - that wavefunction and plus that wavefunction. They are both perfectly fine mathematical representations of the same state, just like the fact that the square root of 9 can be both -3 and 3. When asked: what is the length of the side of a square field of 9 square meters, the answer is indeterminate: it can be either 3 or -3. Rather than saying it can only be positive, we can be a bit more general and say that the \"phase factor\" in front of the three is unphysical: it simply does not matter for calculating the surface area of the field what  it is. We have, of course, some empirical preference for using positive lengths in stead of negative ones, but we do not such physical intuitions for wave functions, as they live in Hilbert Space and we unfortunately only have 4D spacetime to our disposal. Since wavefunctions live in /complex/ Hilbert space, the most general factor that would get $||^2$ away is not $\\pm 1$, but $e^{i\\theta}$, as that simply /is/ the square root of $1$ in $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus any wavefunction will show empirical differences when multiplied with $e^{i\\theta}\\quad\\forall\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\nIt is of course not immediately clear what this has to do with paths in configuration space or anyons for that fact. The answer is that, while systems could theoretically obtain any phase, they do not in general do so. We know from examining the time-dependent Schrodinger equation that it can be reduced to the time-/independent/ schrodinger equation times a phase factor, which depends on time and the energy of the system. However, while we said that phase does not matter physically, this is only the case for the system as a whole: if two systems have different phase they interfere. It's analogous measuring any other kind of wave: you will have to pick a starting point in order to describe the offset of a particular wave. These phases don't matter until you measure two waves interfering, which leads to inteference. For particles this leads to destructive interference for fermions: if the exact same wave would =xxxxxxxxxx= then there is probability zero of it being there. This is the Pauli-exclusion principle.\n\nThus while phases do not appear to matter /prima faciae/, they are the reason matter is able to exist in the first place! Without the Pauli Exclusion Principle it would not be possible for matter to clump together, as everything would simply phase through each other (barring electromagnetic interactions).\n\n\n#+transclude: [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210402123014"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"3cb8cc7b"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"70c4-4613-9f5e-3d73f9c6d476"},{"count":1250,"value":"][The configuration space explanation chapter]] :level 2\n\n\n** The configuration space explanation for anyons\n\nThe topological explanation gestured at above consists of roughly the following steps:\n1.

The most general configuration space we can construct is one for $N$ particles living in $d$ dimensions, which would be\n \n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbb{R}^d_1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_2 ... \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_N\n    \\label{eq:Ndconfig}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (1)$$\n\nWe shall for now focus on just two particles in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which would be the configuration space occupied by two $3$-dimensional vectors $(r_1, r_2)$ representing two particles\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3  \\]\nAs we are dealing with identical particles, however, we need to add some extra structure, which results in our configuration space being much smaller than the above.\n\nTo simplify our notation and avoid having to conceptualize $9$-dimensional space, we can define our configuration space in terms of the center of mass of the particles $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1+r_2})}{2}$ and their difference vector $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r_1-r_2}$. Clearly the configuration space of $(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r})$ is still $\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. However, now we can pull a trick. We only care about exchanging the particles, right? It seems reasonable, therefore, that the position of the system as a whole does not play in a role in determining all possible positions of the particle, e.g. it should not matter (we assume, quite reasonably) whether we exchange two fermions in our lab on Earth or on Venus. For our purposes, then, we can safely ignore one of the two $\\mathbb{R}^3$s and simply focus on the relative distance and orientation of the two particles with each other.[fn:9] This simplifies the problem of finding the configuration space significantly.\n\nLet us return to the constraints. The first constraint is the indistinguishability of the particles. Since it is impossible to distinguish the situation $(r_1,r_2)$ from $(r_2,r_1)$, we cannot take these two configurations to be separate points in configuration space and must remove them. We can represent this by \"dividing out\" the permutation group $S_2$ from our current configuration space,[fn:10] yielding\n\\[\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^3 }{S_2}\\]\n\nThe second and final constraint is accounting for particles not being able to intersect with each other. The argument for /why/ we ought to, however, is rarely made precise. The general tendency, as by\n\n#+transclude: [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210414134239"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"654e4bfd"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"594e-48f2-b6b1-7ad252e1c05c"},{"count":7261,"value":"][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n[fn:9] Another way of thinking about this is to consider one particle to be fixed and the other moving around it.\n\n[fn:10] This makes it somewhat difficult to visually relate the \"one particle standing still\" picture to what the configuration space actually represents. Roughly, you can imagine it as the \"moving\" particle returning back to its original position after a rotation of $\\pi$ radians.\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect\n\nSo, anyons are claimed to be observed in 2D only.\nHowever, some claim that anyons are observed [@Bartolomei2020]  in actual systems. Does this mean that those systems are /actually/ two dimensional? This would go against much of our general intuition about systems.\n- Physisists claim that these systems are /approximatley/ or /effectively/ 2D (=sources=).\n- Following [@Norton2012], we know how to interpret this: we can demote an idealization to an approximation if we are able to show that there is a smooth limit.\n- This is exactly the problem, according to [@Shech2019]: the topological explanation of anyons requires an /exact/ 2D system (or a rather ad-hoc 2D system as we saw).\n- Therefore we cannot call this approximately 2D.\n- According to [@Shech2019], this is a problem for those with nominalist inclinations[fn:1], as the instantiation of abstract mathematical structures in the real world would be an issue.\n  - Such an argument can only be made, however, through the use of the EIA which was discussed in the previous (or next?) chapter.\n- Therefore, it would do such people well to examine the physical effect thoroughly for any signs of this.\n\n\n\nLuckily, hope is on the horizon: it turns out that the computations of the phase of the alledged anyons in the FQHE uses a geometrical notion rather than a topological notion of phase.\n- Unluckily, this geometrical notion also relies on a two dimensional idealization.\n- However, this idealization /could/ conceivably be demoted to an approximation.\n\nIn this chapter, we will examine the inner working of the Quantum Hall Effect. This is needed in order to understand the following\n1. Why do people say that these particles are anyons\n2. What idealizations are made in the explanation of the quantum hall effect separate from the topological one.\n3. ...\n\nReaders less interested in the details can skip to the last subsection of this section =link= and the next section =link=.\n\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect is the quantum version of the classical hall effect, a rather straightforward consequence of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. It was discovered all the way back in =XXXX= by Edwin Hall, who claimed it a novelty which would never have any use-case. Today Hall-Effect sensors are widely used to pick up magnetic fields and rotations of conducting materials. More esoteric applications are as potential long-term space-travel propellants in so-called Hall-Effect thrusters, which are a specific form of ion propolsion, which can generate a low thrust for a very long amount of time.\n\nThe basics of the effect are rather simple\n- Strip which has current flowing through it.\n- Magnetic field perpendicular to that strip\n- Induces Lorentz force which pushes particles to one side, increasing their concentration and creating a potential difference, inducing a voltage changing the resistivity.\n- This resistivity linearly depends on the voltage, which linearly depends on the concentration difference which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field, thus yielding a linear dependence of the resistivity to the strenght of the perpendicular magnetic field.\n- Looks like figure ref:fig:che\n\nHowever, as most classical effects, they only hold in a certain regime. When we clean up the materials, lower the temperature dramatically (<2K) and increase the magnetic field strength considerably, we observe the /Quantum Hall Effect/ (QHE): rather than a linear dependence on the magnetic field strength, the resistivity shows these strange plateaux at rather consistent values, as in ref:fig:qhe. The spacing between these plateaux does not seem to differ between different materials, which is even more curious.\n\nSo: why? Why do we see these plateaux, and why at these levels? The short answer (partially) is: the impurities in the sample lift the degeneracy of the eigenstates of the Quantum Hall system, called Landau levels, and /localizes/ some of those states, rather than the states extending from one edge of the sample to the other (akin to the wavefunctions of a particle in a box). These localized states do not conduct current (as do not span the system, and resistivity is measured from end to end), thus leading to the plateaux in the resistivity: we change plateaux when all the localized states are filled and we move to different extended states. The specific values of these levels depend on weird physics at the boundaries of the system called /edge-modes/, but in short the levels correspond to the number of filled Landau levels: at higher magnetic field strengths the levels can accommodate more states, thus the lower the magnetic field strength the larger the number of available levels, leading to a smooth-looking linear dependence in the classical regime.\n\nThere are quite some caveats to the above story, but that is the gist of why the effect happens for /integer levels/. The less interested reader can skip over the following section describing the corresponding /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/ (IQHE) and head to the description of its fractional cousin, where the same does not hold. Specifically, the IQHE requires one massive idealization: electron interaction is neglected completely. As we shall see, this idealization cannot hold in the FQHE.\n\n[fn:1] If the reader was not aware of this yet, the author does hold such inclinations.\n\n** The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\nIn order to do as little physics as is possibly required, I will skip most of the justification for the quantum formalism of the QHE (quantizing the classical Hamiltonian, finding the commutators) and many of the intermediate steps to arrive at the relevant results. I point the interested reader to [@Tong2016][[]] for a quite accessible and to [@Arovas2020] for a more thorough pedagogical discussion of these issues, and to [@Stone1992; @Prange1987; @Doucot2005] for rather complete, less pedagogical sources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) is the observation of plateaux in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ at regular intervals. These intervals happen to be integer multiples of the /quantum of resistance/  $R_q=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2}$. =check whether this is so=\n- This is rather curious, why so precise?\n- In fact, so precise that these experiments are used to determine the quantum of resistance.\n- Why are they there, and why at those levels?\n\nAs physicists, the first thought as to the origin of these plateaux probably goes to the energy eigenstates of the system, which turns out to be correct! The plateaux correspond to the general energy eigenstates of a system of charged particles moving in a perpendicular magnetic field, so called Landau levels.\n- It will be difficult to properly understand the QHE without first briefly going over landau levels.\n\n=Assumptions=\n\n*** Landau Levels\n\nHere we already start to sneak in our idealizations: we will treat this system as if it is two dimensional. =However, this system can be easily extended to 3D, see XXXX=\n\nThe simplest Hamiltonian for a system of particles moving in a magnetic field is\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2} m(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} +e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} )^2\n    \\label{eq:landauham}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (2)$$\n\nThe  magnetic field is perpendicular to the $x,y$-plane, so we define the vector potential $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}$ using our knowledge that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane $\\nabla\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=B \\hat{z}$, to be\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\nxB\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n    \\label{eq:landaugauge}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (3)$$\n\n=This will be appendix=\nThe easiest way to find the energy eigenstates is the way all Hamiltonians get solved: treat is as the harmonic oscillator. As the Hamiltonian of the \"normal\" harmonic oscillator is\n\n\n..\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x - i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for $\\pi$ then tell us that $a$ and $a^\\dagger$ obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n\\[H= \\frac{1}{2}m \\pi^2   = \\omega_B \\left( a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2}  \\right)\\]\nWe find that the energy eigenlevels are\n\\[\\ket{n}=\\omega_B\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\n*** Calculating the degeneracy\n\nWe started by saying that the plateaux in the IQHE correspond to the various filled Landau levels of the simple particle in a magnetic field system. We still need to prove this, namely by deriving the conductivity for the Hall states. This can get rather messy, so I will show put the derivation for a single particle here, and the more general derivation of the so called /Kubo formula/ in the Appendix.\n\n=sloppy=\n\nTo find the resistivity, we use Ohm's law, which relates the energy of a particle to the current density (current over area)\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{E}=\\sigma \\mathbf{J}\n    \\label{eq:ohm}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (4)$$\n\nOur mechanical momentum is\n\\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} = m \\hat{\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}}\\]\nClassically, the current (for a single particle) is simply $\\mathbf{I}=-e\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}$, but isnce we are working quantum mechanically we take the expectation value\n\n\\[I=-e/m \\sum_filled_states \\bra{\\psi}-i\\hbar\\nabla+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\ket{\\psi} \\]\n\nWe are working in Landau gauge.\n\n...\n\nWe end up with\n*** Edge modes\n\nIn order to provide a more thorough calculation (i.e. not just considering a single electron) we take advantage of a the fact that the system is bounded. I will not reproduce this here.\n\n\n*** Robutsness\n\nThe explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\nThis is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness.\n\nExperimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Figure 1: <<fig:disorder>>Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:disorder\n[[file:./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n#+caption: Figure 2: <<fig:extended>>Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:extended\n[[file:./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (5)$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    | \\Delta V | <<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} |\n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (6)$$\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.=\n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=.\n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see [@Tong2016]\n\n\nThat is it for the IQHE, as we derived the two things we needed from it: we gained a general understanding of why the plateaux have their values (they are the energy eigenvalues of the Landau levels) and, more importantly, we roughly understand why these plateaux are robust.\nUnfortunately, this is not the end of the story, we did not even mention anything topological yet! For that we finally turn to the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.\n\n[fn:5] Improved performance of impure 2D materials is an active area of research in material science, see [@Wang2020] for a summary of how impurities enhance the conductivity of graphene.\n\n[fn:6] The non-dirty sample just discussed is a great example of taking an idealization too seriously: we cannot explain the phenomena in the idealized setting, and have to retrofit extra physics on top of the idealization in order to get a satisfying explanation, only for us to then show in the limit of no impurities we regain our initial idealization. If this limit would not have been smooth (it fortunately is), we would have wasted all this time!\n\n\n** The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nFollowing the naming convention of the IQHE, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) refers to the observation of plateaux at /fractional/ values of the quantum of resistance in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$. Sadly, very few of the arguments mentioned above will be able to explain these plateaux, as we have only shown that they appear at fully filled Landau levels. However, our intuition about the robustness will still hold.\n\n\nThe goal of this expos\\'e is twofold. First we want to gain a general understanding of how the FQHE is thought about in general: what assumptions go into calculating the relevant parameters, which idealizations are noteworthy, etc. The other main goal is the 'derivation' of the Laughlin wavefunction, the wavefunction used to describe the FQH system, and its excitations. At the end we will arrive at the problem of calculating the exchange statistics of these excitations, which turn out to be /anyons/, but not actually compute them yet: this will be done in section ref:sec:GeometricPhase.\n\n\nThe key difference between the description of the Fractional as opposed to the Integer Quantum Hall effect is the inclusion of electron interactions in the former, which becomes impossible to ignore at the energy scales above $\\nu=1$, which is where most of the FQHE physics is done. As a result the reasoning cannot be as rigorous as before. In the IQHE we could pretend that all the states occupied the same Landau level, which allowed us to calculate the wavefunctions and energy levels, leading to the derivation of the Hall resistivity and confirm our suspicion that the plateaux correspond to fully filled Landau levels. Only after doing that did we let go of that idealization and allow the degeneracy to be lifted in order to argue that the plateaux were robust.\n\nThis order of operation is no longer possible in the FQHE, as the electron interactions lift the degeneracy of the Landau levels from the start, forcing us to compute the wavefunctions in a different way. A first approach would be to use perturbation theory: model the electron interaction as a small perturbation to ref:eq:landauham and then gradually compute a better and better approximation to the actual wavefunction. While this is fine for simple two-electron systems, the number of electrons in a QH system is closer to $10^{23}$. That is a rather large matrix to diagonalize, not even close to possible to do numerically. Therefore, we need to pull some tricks.\n\nThe trick is: do not compute the wave function, just write one down. That is exactly what [@Laughlin1983] did, yielding what we now call the *Laughlin wavefunction*\n\n[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210311182300"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"fff6c214"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"the_laughlin_wavefunction.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"ce92-4f4f-be7f-71eb21efff79"},{"count":1220,"value":"][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]\n\nLaughlin of course did not just simply write down a bunch of wavefunction and pick the one he liked best, it is motivated by some observations from the system and from some general conditions we have to place on any wavefunction. Specifically, in a previous paper [@Laughlin1983a] he derived the wavefunctions for three particles in the FQHE. Recapping this in the case of two electrons is worthwhile.\n\nWe have a system of two electrons with a potential $V(|r_1-r_2|)$.\n- To solve such systems, it's easiest to work with angular momentum.\n- If we want to work with angular momentum, the gauge we picked before (Landau Gauge) is not very useful, as it does not include any kind of rotation\n  - Instead we pick /symmetric gauge/, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\times \\mathbf{B}= -yB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + xB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n- Skipping multiple steps ahead, we see that the wavefunctions look like\n\nUnfortunately this does not uniquely or straightforwardly generalize to N particles, so we have to pull a few more tricks.\n1. We do try to generalize, and say that a wavefunction for N particles will look something like $f(z)e^{something}$\n2. We /insist/ that the wavefunction be in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) it can possibly be: there are no other Landau levels it can fall back on. This is rather strong. This leads to the claim that $f(z)$ /must/ be analytic. =how=\n3. Since the state will have to describe fermions, the wave function must be anti-symmetric under exchange of the particles, which requires $f(z)$ to be odd.\n4.

While this might work as a prediction, i.e. if we can figure out the configuration space and then the fundamental group, we might reasonably expect to find particles with such and such quantum statistics there.\n\nHowever, I do not find this very satisfactory as an explanation, it feels much too close to a DN way of explaining things, which, as we know [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210330165632"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"0efec85b"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"problems_with_the_dn_model.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"7a67-4c32-9760-73a6f663e713"},{"count":943,"value":"][DN cannot determine whether something is a difference maker]]. That is, the explanation works backwards: instead of ending uncontrovertably with the most controversial point, namely that the configuration space of the anyons is 2D, it arrives there kind of casually.\n\n\n\nThe order of explanation as it is usually given is like this:\n1. We have observed fractional quantum statistics (alledgedly, i'm willing to grant that at this point)\n2. /The quantum statistics of the particle are determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space/\n3. The 1D rep of the Braid group is fractional quantum statistics\n4. The Braid group is the first homotopy group of a non-simply connected 2D configuration space\n5. Therefore particles which exhibit fractional quantum statistics need to have a 2D configuration space\n\n\nNow, if all of the above steps /necessarily/ are /if and only ifs/, this argument is rather water tight. However, I would dispute that this is the case here, first and foremost on the grounds that this conclusion is /primae facie/ unacceptable and a paradox, so something seems to go wrong here. We can either resolve this paradox by correcting our physics to allow for precisely 2D configuration spaces, or, what seems more agreeable to me, by not allowing the argument to reach this conclusion, as I do not believe every single on of the steps above are if and only ifs.\n\nSpecifically, I have trouble with step 2, as we appear to need some theorem in order to establish this but I have not really found such a theorem, just vague gestures to the fact that these statistics come from the worldlines being intertwined and whatnot.\n\nThe other way around the explanation looks a lot less secure\n\n1. The configuration space describing the exchange of two identical particles contains a hole in the origin and is thus non-simply connected\n2. Such a space has an infinite number of homotopy classes of equivalent (i.e. continuously deformable into each other) paths\n3. The fundamental group/first homotopy group of these paths is the Braid group\n4. The 1D rep of this group is $e^{i\\theta}$\n5. /This is the spin of the particles we are interested in/\n\n\n** The problem with treating this as a DN explanation\n\nThe problem with treating this a DN explanation is that that requires that the Laws of Nature used are true and ALSO the events described as premises. However, there are not really any of the latter, as we can't take the existence of a 2D things as a premise, as that is weird.\n\n[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210405144616"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"76a2711e"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"eia_allows_us_to_verify_dn_premises.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"8e05-4058-9808-3cefeffce717"},{"count":3197,"value":"][EIA allows us to verify DN premises]]\n\n\n** COMMENT Brief critique summary\n\n** Leng says: \"Platonism is not real, because we can just say that physical space approximately instantiates mathematical structures, so we don't need that exactness\"\n\n** Shech says: \"We cannot use approximate instantiation if we assume approximation means how Norton says it and if we use the EIA.

The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.\n\nInstead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.\n\nWith \"finding an alternative route\", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.\n1. Bob takes anti-conception pills\n2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant\nC. Bob does not become pregnant.\n\nWhile we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with. This idealization might not be as problematic however. (this is later or earlier, haven't figured out where to put it)\n\n=garbo=\nNext, we have an equally unpromising candidate, which is the \"mini-explanation\". The fundamental group of 2D exchange under two particles is the Braid group\nE. The fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of $N$ identical particles in 2D is $B_N$\nL. The quantum statistics of a particle is the 1D rep of the fundamental group of the ...\nC. The quantum statistics of 2D particles are anyonic i.e. $e^{i\\theta}$\n(I'm being loose with the structure here, as otherwise it would be a huge drag to write everything out, i.e. \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of two identical particles is $e^{i\\theta}$\", \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group ... are the quantum statistics\", .... (secretly I don't really know how to write this out DN style as the example laws are always extremely simple conditionals, nor do I really know how to transfer this to theorems rather than laws. If this is a big problem we can discuss this, I think more likely I will have to get rid of the reference to the DN explanation or formulate this differently entirely. Regardless, this is more an example of how I wish to argue))\n=garbo=\n\n...\n\nThe most promising candidate for such an intervention is centered around the fundamental group of the system, but not in the way that the argument is presented by Shech. Instead let us examine how the argument goes once more:\n\nWe see the Quantum Hall Effect manifest\n\n** COMMENT Checklist\n\n To show it can be approximated, I need to show that there are /some/ paths which are nondeformable into one another/non collapsible to a point. In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*\n\n** Options\n\n*** Particles have nonzero size\n\nIn these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.\n\n*** Not ALL paths\n\nWhile the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.\n\n\n*** Winding can be something different?\nThe main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.\n\n#+transclude: t\n[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210403175539"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"0bbb9ce7"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"group.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"191f-4fde-8924-cad8a3886e2e"},{"count":762,"value":"][Group]]\n\n\n\n\n** COMMENT Junk\n\n Startingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.\n\n However, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one.

This is not a new thought, but one I wish to explore in this thesis.\n\n** Specifically: words seem to denote a very precise ontological thing, but our epistemological capacities arent that precise\n\nI believe there exists a massive mismatch between the way we use language (names and/or concepts in particular) and how we conceptualize the ontology of the world. In short it is this: the _names_ we use for objects and _concepts_ in our language are discrete, while the space underlying them is continuous. That is, while we use names and concepts as if they have a definite _boundary_, there does not seem to be a clear line we can draw between the object and not-object, the concept and not-concept. Their boundary seems to be _vague_, indeterminate, fuzzy, etc.\n\n(this is not really a good example, I could start with \"human\" or \"the human that X\" or something. It's a much more familiar and vivid example, but it does veer into philosophy of biology more easily, so I'm weary to use it as a starting off point. Ideally I'd use a physics example but I don't have one that's quite so vidid as \"human\")\nNames and the objects they refer to are discrete in the way that one definite signifier is intented to represent one definite object or kind of object (natural kinds, I think): it is implied that the name refers to something with a definite spatio-temporal boundary. The problem of vagueness arises from the contrast between this proposed definiteness of boundary with the actual continuity of space, which does not lend itself to having distinct, point-like boundaries. In some cases this is more apparent than others. Take the name \"the football used in the 2016 world cup finals\" and the object it refers to, the actual football. The name implies, by use of \"the\", that there is one unique object, the actual football, it describes.\n\nAt first glance this appears uncontroversial: there is only one football which was used during the final, no exchanges were made and no \"multi-ball\" rule was suddenly introduced. The issue however is that we do not believe that footballs are fundamental constituents of reality, were there to be such things as fundamental consituents of reality. Instead we think that footballs are composed of smaller objects which may be fundamental consituents of reality, such as molecules, atoms, protons, quarks, and so forth. This fact leads to there not being a one to one mapping between the name \"the football used in the 2016 World Cup finals\" and a definite set of fundamental consituents of reality in a number of ways.\n\nThe first is a basic line drawing problem. This problem in fact already presents itself without thinking of the football as being composed of smaller consituents, as it is a consequence of the presumed continuity of space. It is not possible to pinpoint the exact location where the ball begins and ends, simply because it is not possible to measure a real number.\n\nThe second is due to specific physical theories: because of the uncertainty principle, there simply is no fact of the matter where the final electron belonging to the football and not to not-the-football is located in space, except of the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which is not per se popular.\n\nThe third and final issue with delineating the football is a more familiar matter: our idea of \"the football\" is not so fine-grained as to allow for the minute differences that happen to the football over the course of even a second. Kicking the football will result in some molecules separating from the main clump, perhaps adding some from the dirt, some of its atoms will decay, it will radiate away some heat and absorb some more: the exact state of the football changes across its life, second to second, moment to moment.\n\nThis third problem is best conceptualized using the Sorites paradox, which is not specific to names but to properties and concepts more generally as well. The basic idea can be summarized as follows: ten thousand grains of rice makes a heap of rice (or X collection of atoms make up \"the football\"). 9.999 grains of rice still make up a heap, as does 9,998. It appears that if N grains of rice make up a heap, then N-1 grains of rice also make up a heap. However, by mathematical induction, this would force us to conclude that any x grains of rice makes up a heap, including 1 grain of rice, which is patently false. To combat this, we can postulate that there exists a definite boundary between \"being a heap\" and \"not being a heap\". However, since the only way in which we can affect the heap is by adding or subtracting a grain of rice, this would lead to the other false conclusion that there exists an x such that X grains of rice do not make a heap while X+1 grains of rice do make a heap, which goes against the premises of the first argument: a true paradox.\n\n** I don't want to directly tackly meaning/vagueness/boundaries because it's hard. Instead I will look at physics because I know physics, and they sort of do this\n\nThese problems are deep and substantial, and while tackling them head on might be an option, I instead wish take a more roundabout route for exploring them by relating them to an area that explicitly deals with making precise denotations of an continuous mess: physics.\n\n** Physical Models/Idealization\n\nI take it as uncontroversial that physicists construct models, such as the Standard Model of Particle Physics, with a goal being to, at the very least, at some point make predictions about the outcomes of experiments. I furthermore take physics to be that what physicists do. Therefore one of the goals of physics is to construct models which make accurate predictions about the outcomes of experiments. This is a very conservative picture of physics.\n\n** Physics is a good case study as they use models which are analogous to the thing im interested in\n\nThe link between physics and the way words represent concepts becomes more clear when taking a slightly more ambitious stance towards the enterprise of physics, namely as constructing models which, in one or more aspects, _represent the world_. Representing an aspect of the world through a model is analogous to representing an object by a name, or more generally a concept by a word: continuous nature is fit into rigid molds. Investigating this link, therefore, might show us something about language more generally.\n\n** Too difficult on its own, let's just look at idealizations or abstractions\n\nHowever, attempting to evaluate how, if at all, physics represents \"reality\" directly proves no less difficult than attempting to determine that for words, concepts, objects, natural kinds etc. in general. Here, too, we need to narrow our scope to attack this question in any sensible way. I propose that the relevant aspect of physical modelling lies in its employment of idealizations and abstractions in order to simplify the mess that is continuous reality.\n\nAlthough the nature of idealizations and abstractions (henceforth I will just write idealization) will be spelled out in more detail later, it is worth noting some of its basic features and some similarities with the larger issue of denotation.\n\n\n(For the moment I will treat idealizations and abstractions as basically being the same thing, idealizations probably being more specific than abstractions. It is important and necessary to determine whether these do amount to the same thing however, see for instance cite:Shapiro2004, cite:mancosuAbstractionInfinity2016, cite:Lutz or cite:Knox2016 or cite:2016\nAlthough one clear difference does already spring to mind: idealizations are usually strictly false, while abstractions are more akin to generalizations, in that they are not false but simply cover more phenomena. Idealizations might not be a subtype of abstraction, but maybe a feature of it. I might start by introducing abstractions first, then focusing on idealizations later as a way to tackle that, but I am not sure of that step yet.)\n\n** Why should we pick idealizations\n\n   The solution is to pick specific aspects of a model that get close to the problem at hand. To this end I suggest using the idea of an \"idealization\", as idealizations are somewhat analogous to what I see as discreitziation, and are an import component of models. One of the key tasks will be to first flesh out the concept of an idealization, how necessary they are to models and how the relate to discretization. This will be done in chapter [[file:../../.local/share/Trash/files/20210106131334-chapter_idealizations_meta.org][Chapter Idealizations (meta)]]. I will specifically have a look at a subclass of idealizations: infinite or infinitesimal idealizations. This is because I believe they highlight what goes wrong with idealizations more clearly in a way that mirrors the general problem of discretization.\n\n** TODO Why Infinite idealizations\n*** Actual reason: (Shech makes this literal argument)\n*** What is an infinite idealization\n\nAn infinite idealization is an idealization in which some relevant property is set to 0 or infinity, rather than approximating it as being arbitrarily small or large.\n\n*** How does it differ from a normal idealization\n\nInfinite idealizations differ from \"normal\" or simple idealizations, to borrow cite:Strevens2019a 's terminology, in which a value is simply set to some other value.\n\n*** What's the goal of an infinite idealization\n\nFirst we must separate what an infinite idealization does from what it is meant to do.\n\n*** Infinite idealizations lead to problems\n**** Limit system does not exist\n**** Limit system disagrees with actual system\n** EIA\n*** Physical models and their idealizations are only a good case study if they are claimed to represent trutfully/literally\n\nThe relation between idealizations/abstractions and aspects of the world does not prove to be such a direct candidate for comparison between names and objects so easily, as there exists an important difference between the rough picture of physics sketched above and the question of how to match the discrete objects to continuous \"name space\": the models of physics do not per se truthfully represent the world, at least not until we stipulate such a thing. In contrast, when talking about the problem of discrete names not matching their continuous objects, the problem only arises when we imagine the word to truthfully represent the object, or, less strongly, to factor into true propositions about that object e.g. \"the football is round\". Similarly, models can only be used to study the boundary problem if we stipulate that the truthfully represent the world in some relevant aspect. (the relevant aspect quantifier is there because we do not expect our current models to grasp every relevant structure of the world, e.g. no emperically backed theory of quantum gravity exists as of yet.)\n\n*** Scientific realism claims that the idealizations truthfully represent\n\nFortunately, a rich philosophical tradition exists which espouses just the view that physical models truthfully represent, at least in some respect, the world: scientific realism. This tradition is no monolith however, and many competing and often incompatible interpretations exist, some more modest than others. More conservative, modern takes on the subject such as the structuralist realism espoused by James Ladyman and John Ross, are not easily said to believe that physical theories \"represent\" some relevant aspect of the world, rather they claim that such models \"latch on\" to relevant structures of the world, whatever they may be.\n\n*** The EIA as a case study/representative of scientific realism\n\nFor the purposes at hand, namely to elucidate how, if at all, the continuum can be discretized, it is more instructive to at least initially turn our gaze to stronger, more bold variations on scientific realism. The strongest seriously discussed version of scientific realism are based on Putnam-Quine style indispensability arguments, the \"naive\" version of which goes as follows:\n\n**** \"Naive\" Indispensability Argument\n\n    1. We ought to believe in the existence of those entities which are indispensable to our best scientific theories.\n    2. X is indispensable to our best scientific theories\n    C. We ought to believe in the existence of X\n\n   The \"naive\" is put in scare quotes here because this version of the indispensability argument has (more than) one shortcoming, in it leaving unclear what being indispensable to a scientific theory entails. What is it to be dispensable to a theory? To solve this, the modern form of the argument, the \"Enhanced Indispensability Argument\" (EIA), is used instead, which goes as follows:\n\n**** Enhanced Indispensability Argument (EIA)\n\n   P1. We ought to believe in the existence of those entities which are indispensable to our best scientific explanations\n   P2. X is indispensable to our best scientific explanations\n   C. We ought to believe in the existence of X\n\nThe focus has now shifted from indispensability for our best scientific theories to explanations in stead. This move is motivated by two thoughts. For one, it assumes that to succeed as a scientific theory is to offer a good explanation, or at the very least that providing a good explanation is good enough grounds to believe in its existence, provided that being indispensable to our best scientific theories is more than sufficient already. That is, offering good explanations is a necessary condition for being a good theory, as we do not think a theory succeeds without it. It is close to being a sufficient condition for constituting a good scientific theory as well, but I am hesitant to claim so on the grounds that what consitutes a \"good\" explanation is rather contentiuous, as we shall see, and that the number of phenomena a theory can explain does seem to matter as well. I do not believe that an extremely specific theory which somehow makes little to no reference to existing theories and is able to explain a single phenomenon well would count as a succesful one (although it might be argued that calling this an explanation would be questionable, but I digress).\n\nSecond, it carries with it the hope that \"being indispensable to explanation\" is easier to clarify than \"indispensability to a theory.\" This second thought requires one to buy that a) scientific explanation can be satisfactorily defined and delineated from not-\"scientific explanations\", which includes both non-explanations and non-scientific explanations (henceforth with \"explanation\" I will mean \"scientific explanation\" unless otherwise specified). Furthemore, it requires us to find plausible that b) finding that which is indispensable for those explanations is more straightforward than for theories as a whole. I will not grant these moves immediately and will scrutinize them in what's to come.\n\n*** What can the truth or falsity of the EIA possibly lead to\n\nBefore saying why looking at the Putnam-Quine argument could provide us insight on the much more general problem of discretization, let us first evaluate what sort of conclusions we could draw from our investigation. To start, let us say that thoroughly examining the Putnam-Quine argument leads us to consider it a valid form of inference to the actual consituents of the world, and furthermore we find entities or other things for which the argument holds. Our quest would then be complete, as we have found a way to justify dividing up the continuum of space and time (or \"thought space\" in the case of mathematical objects) into discrete, consituent parts (given that the entities which enter in the argument are discrete, which I will argue later they are). This provides a sufficient answer to the \"if at all\" part, and sheds some light on the \"how\" part, though does not exhaust the possibilities. For instance, it would provide little clarity on how, if at all, we do so in ordinary language when talking about footballs and tables, except if we take the EIA to be an exhaustive guide to all actual entities, something which the argument cannot entail in its form stated above.\n\n*** If we were to find that (infinite) idealizations do not factor into the EIA, why is it useful for the main problem of \"discretization\"\n\nAs the reader might have expected, I am not so optimistic about the EIA's chances of meeting the demands to be spelled out. How, then, would investigating it yield us any fruitful information about discretization? For if the EIA does not turn out to be a valid form of inference for determining the discrete parts of reality, it would not rule out the possibility of doing so, much less show us why it is impossible in the first place. In particular, the EIA provides a sufficient condition for something to have ontological status, not a necessary one. Therefore failing to be indispensable to explanation does preclude any entity/structure from having ontological status. (Is this true? Is the EIA not \"those and only those\"?)\nThis concern is real and valid. In fact, finding that the EIA is not valid would not rule out anything about the discretization on its own. Instead, the EIA provides a case study in which to more concretely tackle an instance of this problem, and my hope is that by examing its workings applied to specific examples to be expounded upon below, we might learn something valuable about the more general problem in the process. Given the scope and generality of the issue, it would be extremely optimistic to hope to solve it in a lifetime, much less one thesis, so my aims are more humble: to extract from the EIA some valuable lessons for tackling the discretization problem (or whatever you want to call it.)\n\n*** Why it's worth looking at idealization at the EIA (again)\n\nAs mentioned previously, we seem to have lost the \"how\" in the \"how, if at all\" formulation of the main question in the step of attempting to apply the EIA to idealizations. One argument in favor of this step is that it is a necessary condition for explaining \"how\" something works, /that/ it works at all first. Additionally, the hope is that by showing \"how not\" the EIA, we learn something about \"how not\" to answer the question of discreteness. While the possibilities for discretization are technically endless, humans only need a finite number of counterexamples in order to be dissuaded of the usefulness of something. This rather severe limitation might then be a better starting point: to provide reason for distrusting discretization of continua, rather than providing a direct counterargument. If a direct counterargument comes up, so much the better. If we end up concluding that (infinite) idealizations cannot factor into the EIA, at least we have something.\n\n*** Two ways of evaluating the EIA: P1 and P2\n\nIn order for the EIA to be a sound argument, its premises must entail its conclusion and its premises need to be true. The argumentative structure of the EIA is as straightforward as it gets, so it is valid. The premises, however, are controversial to say the least. Therefore the soundness of the EIA hinges on the acceptance of its premises, meaning that there are two ways the EIA could fail: either it is not true that we ought to believe in those entities that are indispensable to our best scientific explanations, or the relevant entity X is not indispensable for our best scientific theories. Let us say something about each of these in turn.\n\n**** What does arguing against premise 1 give us\n\nRegarding permise 1, arguing against the premise that we ought to believe in those entities that are indispensable for our best scientific theories is arguably the strongest move one could make, as it prevents the argument from taking off at all. Such a line of argument is common among anti-realists.\n\n**** Why not to tackle premise 1\n\nHowever, I would prefer not to take this line of argument for two reasons. For one, I feel it is not so convincing to the putative realist. Many convincing anti-realist arguments have already been made by van Fraassen etc, so I find it unlikely I would be able to sway a realist by making such an argument. Secondly, a succesful argument against premise 1. would take the form of one of the following:\na) argue against explanations, either playing a (crucial) role in forming our explanations or the possibility of explanations in general\nb) argue against indispensability as a criterion for belief in entities\nc) argue against believing in entities, whether some specific entities or entities in general.\n\na) and b) would not entail much at all about the discretization question, while an argument for c) could instead directly be used as an argument for the main problem or again not entail much, as \"we ought not to believe in the existence of entity X\" would simply remove X from the list of things to consider demarcatably, while \"we ought not to beleve in any entity X (which has certain general properties)\" could be reformed as \"we are not able to demarcate discrete objects with property X\", which defeats the point of using the EIA at all.\n\n**** We should look into premise 2 instead\n\n   Therefore, I wish to focus on premise 2: X is indispensable to our best scientific theories. One might immediately object that this is subject to the same charges as before, namely that looking at some class of objects X, say electrons, will likely not entail much about the conclusion in general. The way around this is to pick our X carefully. A candidate could be models in general, as finding out that models are not indispensable would make us not have to believe in them, and if models are analogous to concepts in the sense that they discretize a messy continuum, this might show us something about how this is done in general. However, this is too broad a task, as (almost) all physical explanation concerns models and what consitutes a model is (ironically) difficult to define. This is then subject to the same charge as that for denying explanation outright, or just impossible.\n\n*** Why not use this for premise 1 tho\n\nBut why can we not pick infinite idealizations for conclusion 1 instead, i.e. argue whether or not we ought to believe in the \"existence\" of infinite idealizations if they are necessary for our best scientific explanations, rather than evaluating whether they are in fact dispensable or not? Good question. I believe that arguing against the conditional, be that by denying the consequent or the antecedent, is getting ahead of ourselves. It makes the thing not so useful.\n\n*** TODO MORE TEXT JUSTIFYING WHY IM TACKLING THE EIA ON ITS SECOND PREMISE GOES HERE\n* On explanation\n\nBefore evaluating the indispensablity of certain entities/whatever to the purported explanation of physical phenomena, we need to come to an agreement how, if at all, these explanations explain.\n\nThe stance Shech takes to explanation is a sociological (?) one: explanations are what scientists call explanations. According to Shech, it is not the role of the philosopher to dictate what are good or bad explanations, to say what is good or bad science. \"If one's favorite account of explanation does not account for the standard story [of explaining the FQHE], so much the worse for one's favorite account of explanation\", he says determinately.\n\nI am have two conflicting thoughts on the subject.\n\nOn the one hand, I agree that judging a purported explanation only by reference to \"the\" correct account of explanation is unwise. The decades long debate on explanation has yielded little in the way of consensus about the correct account of explanation, even by the low bar of what is considered consesus in philosophy. Even the deductive nomological account, while seen by many as fatally flawed by not being able to account for the assymetric nature of explanation or being able to distinguish explanatory relevant factors from explanatorily irrelevant ones, is still the most commonl way of explicating explanation, usually prefaced with a half-hearted acknowledgment that is indeed flawed and that these half-hearted apologetics for using it anyway are a cliche in themselves. Other accounts, such as the unificationist account by Kitcher and that other guy, the plethora of causal mechanical models, the interventionist account, mechanistic ones etc, while not enjoying the widespread adoption of the DN model, are still being argued over, with nothing close to a definitive distancing from any of them being the case.\n\nTherefore, arguing the wrongness of an explanation based on it not fitting a certain model of explanation is not particularly convincing for two reasons. One, it requires one to first convince the reader that this account of explanation is the correct one (just trust me), which as seen above, does not seem particularly likely. Secondly, ??\n\nOn the other hand, however, I do not wish to simply do away with any sort of measure of explanatoriness (definitely a word) and to uncritically accept the explanations offered by scientists.\n\nCould lead us to accept bad explanations. Supersymmetry?\n\nHow do we know when the scientific community has accepted something?\n\nTreating the word of scientists as gospel like this does a disservice to them, as it sort of presumes scientists don't and moreover cant set critiria for what is a good explanation.\n\nThis division between philosophy and science seems kind of weird.\n\nWe might be able to identify some common criteria of those things we consider good explanations. For instance, we do not have strongly believe that super symmetry is a good exlpanation for (INSERT WHAT SUPER SYMMETRY EXPLAINS) anymore. Do we believe this simply because physicists have moved on or because there are good reasons for not believing its explanatory capabilities? The latter of course, empirical adequacy is a very important one, which is also a reason we don't consider most of the claims of string theory as explanatory correct.\n\n\nHowever, we must be weary of not simpy defining another concept of explanation. Instead, there are two ways of evaluating the question \"how, if at all, does theory/argument/... X explain phenomenon Y\"?\n\n1. Evaluate whether for every theory of explanation the theory explains. This is the most comprehensive way of tackling the question, and can lead to two answers, only the latter of which is really satisfying\n   a) theory X explains phenomenon Y on accounts of theory of explanation A, B, and C, but not on account of D, E, etc. Therefore, if one believes theories A, B, or C to be the correct theory of explanation, the X explains Y.\n      The problem with this is that either one ends up arguing for the validity of A B or C, which as discussed is dubious or simply leaves it up for the reader to decide for themselves if they believe A B or C, which lacks quite some argumentative force.\n   b) according to all common theories of explanation A, B, ... X does/does not explain Y. Therefore it is plausible to assume X does/does not explain Y, as every theory agrees on the subject.\n   Not only is this quite the amount of work, it is unlikely that we would reach such unanymous agreement, as some theories have widely varying criteria for explanation. Consider for isntance the differnce between causal mechanical and unifying explanations for instance: the former requires an account of how the phenomenon comes to be from the fundamental constituents of the thing and can decide per explanation whether it explains or not, while the latter only requires an explanation to group some set of phenomenon and is not able to say of an individual explanation whether it is \"good\" or not (as most explanations will probably unifity ~some~ phenomena), only whether one explanation is better than another. Comparing the question \"account X constitutes as a good explanation for Y\" (as we are interested in our \"best\" scientific explanations, whatever that may mean) for both the unficationist and the causal mechanical model will therefore prove quite challenging, as a good causal mechanical explanation is just a causal mechanical explanation, while the \"goodness\" of a unificationist explanation is much more graded.\n\n   These are just some of the challenges that come to mind, but again I deem it unlikely unanymous agreement unlikely in the first place, let alone satisfactorily determining whether every explanation is adequate. Does the thermodynamic limit prove a good explanation under all these accounts? Causal mechanical it is certainly doubtful, although some have argued otherwise, see Strevens.\n\n2. Determine some shared criteria all accounts of explanation (should) obey, and evaluate whether these explanations match these criteria.\n\n   This method has two pitfalls\n\n   a) If they obey all of the criteria, this does not mean that it is a successful explanation per se. The criteria only serve a negative purpose, barring would be explanations from attaining such status, as it provides only necessary conditions, no sufficient ones, by design.\n\n   b) Being arbitrarily normative, or rather begging the question\n      If one were to define exclusion criteria for what ought to count as explanation, we need to watch out that we do not beg the question. We must take great care to justify these exclusion criteria, otherwise it can come across as us simply taking elements from these explanations and labeling them as bad. Furthermore the risk exists of excluding an entire category of explanatory theories, which defeats the point.\n\n      (This might happen for instance when one assumes that a good explanation ought to determine which objects in said explanation \"make a difference\", see e.g. cite:DeBianchi2016 )\n\n**** TODO Figure out whether the difference maker discussion excludes the DN model or unificationist model\n*** Goal of the explanation strategy\n\nIn short, the goal in this section is to identify exclusion criteria for explanations that do not\n  a) have arbitrary justification\n  b) exclude an entire theory of explanation\n  c) postulate a new theory of explanation, i.e. be a sufficient condition for explaining.\n     I am not exactly sure what this would look like, but I have one criterion that looks like this\n\n*** Another objection\n\nHow /can/ you identify such criteria? What source of \"explanation\" are you drawing from? The platonic ideal of explanation?\n\nThis is a valid point, but one I can't really answer right now, maybe I'll have a smart reply later.\n\n*** The criteria\n**** TODO A lot. This will form the very foundation of my thesis, while being the most specific part. In order to give a better account here I need to look into the specific phenomena more deeply. What would I gain from that? I feel like I can formulate that to make sense somehow. Self-consistency? Is that different than non-contradiction? It's more of a given,\n**** 1. To warm up, let us begin by defining the most basic criteria any explanation ought to satisfy: it needs to account for the actual empirical thing, save the phenomena as we are fond of saying.\n\n   - Is this part of explanation or of a theory?\n\n**** 2. It needs to follow some sort of \"because\" clause.\n\n   - Very general\n\n**** 3. ...\n**** 4. ...\n**** 5. It needs to create /understanding/ in some agent.\n\n   This might the most crucial one and the most difficult to define. It does hinge on the question: do explanations exist independently of agents to understand them?\n   While this is a difficult question to answer, we need not do so here, provided that it satisfies our earlier defined points, namely is it arbitrary, does it exclude an entire theory of explanation or does it postulate a new one. Let's treat them in turn\n\n***** Arbitrariness\n\n        I'd say no. While not unobjectionable, it certainly does not seem arbitrary or begging the question, as for instance a criterion such as \"no infinities allowed\" would be. Discussion s about udnerstanding and its importance for explanation have been held for a long time in otrher gidelds and have more recently come up in philsophy of science.\n        Moreover it is at least pragmatically true that we would not be aware of any explanations that did not probive any\n\n***** Exclude an entire theory of explanation\n\n        While few of the majors actively include understanding, I argue that none would be significantly changed by including the requirement that they provide understanding.\n\n***** Too sufficient\n\n        This is arguably the biggest charge one could levy against this criterion, since \"providing understanding\" in the sense that someone understands a phenomena after hearing something which does that, sounds like it is explained to them. In order for it not to be sufficient, there need to be things missing from any (set of) proposition(s) which provide understanding, which need to be fulfilled in order to be considered an explanation.\n\n        One thing that comes to mind is that the agent /thinks/ it gained understanding, but in actuality the \"explantion\" which did so is false. Conspiracy theories would constitute such a case: our agent might believe that they gained understanding of the increasing number of autism diagnoses by being \"explained\" that if you get vaccinated then you get autism (or become more likely to get autism) and that the number of vaccinations given has increased. However, the first premise here is false. Has the agent then gained understanding of the increased rate of autism diagnoses? Or more importantly, does the \"explanation\" count as an explanation?\n\n        This would not count as an explanation on all counts of explanation.\n        1. DN: requires all premises to be true. Premise 1 is not true. Therefore not an explanation.\n        2. Causal mechanical: there does not appear that a true causal story of vaccines to autism can be told, therefore not true.\n        3. Interventionist: difficult to tell. While for a single individual it might be possible to intervene here, take an individual without autism and give them a vaccine, see if they develop autism. However few would claim that every single vaccine would cause autism, as most of the world would then be on the spectrum. It seems a lot more difficult to intervene in the course of history and not vaccinate everyone and to then compare whether the autism diagnosis rate remains the same. Counterfactual speculation seems difficult here, therefore it does not appear to be a good explanation.\n        4. Unificationist: as mentioned before, for unificationist accounts, \"good\" is relative. However, since we are interested in what our best scientific explanations are, we can compare this explanation of the increasing vaccine rate with a different one and evaluate which one has the greater unifying power. there's probably one right\n\n    So it might not count as an explanation, mostly on the fact that it is not true or better explanations exist. However, does it count as creating understanding?\n\n****** TODO Evaluate whether this counts as understanding\n\n            - Find definition/theories of understanding\n            - Apply them\n\n**** 6. \"It must match reality in some way\"\n\nThis is definitely begging the question man, we are trying to find this very thing remember? The hell does matching reality mean.\n\n**** 7. The explanation must not create a contradiction\n\nDuh. This seems like to banal to even mention, not sure if I can draw some interesting conclusions out of this.\n\nWhat I'm thinking about is the thermodynamic limit implying the existence of infinity particles, or FQHE implying 2D particles. However, I cannot take this as refuting the fact that they are explanations, as this is exactly the point of contention. Furthermore it's not a flat out paradox, as it is at least logically possible that some particles could be 2D, it is just very plausible /prima facie/.\n\n(Ideally after this section I'd have some kind of idea/criteria for what to look for in a good explanation. My worry is that doing this /before/ looking at the actual examples I either miss things or end up defining criteria based on my discussion of the examples later, which messes up the structure. Therefore I am uncertain of the place of a chapter on explanations in the structure)\n\n* Part II: The phenomena\n** Limit explanation of phase transitions\n\nIn thermodynamics, phase transitions (such as water boiling, a magnet losing its magnetization) are represented by a non-analyticity in the relevant thermodynamic function (such as pressure or magnetization).  The issue is that we do not consider thermodynamics to be the final theory of the world, and in particular do not find it sufficiently explanatory. Moreover, we have a theory we consider to be more \"fundamental\" than thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and would like to account for the phenomenon of phase transitions in said theory.\n\nHowever, the issue arises that the only way in which to directly recapture the thermodynamic phase transitions using statistical mechanical tools is by taking the so called \"thermodynamic limit\", in which the number of particles is taken to infinity while the volume of said particles goes to zero, keeping the density constant. This is because the thermodynaic variables needed for describing the phase transition in statistical mechanics are derived from the partition function, which is a sum of analytic functions. In order for the thermodynamic variables to exhibit a phase transition i.e. a non-analyticity, the partition must contain a singularity. The partition function can only do so if either the energy of the particles is 0, which is impossible, or if the sum is infinite. This latter result is not trivial, nor is it straightforwardly a theorem, but it is commonly accepted as such, see Kadanov.\n\nTherefore, in order to account for (to explain?) the phenomenon of phase transitions, it is claimed, the thermodynamic limit must be taken i.e. we need to make an infinite idealization. Moreover, it cannot easily be explained away by interpreting this \"limiting operation\" as an approximation, i.e. as one of simply seeing the the collection of atoms to be arbitrarily large. One cannot approximate a singularity: it is either there or not there. Therefore, only at N=infinity does the singularity present itself, not at any point beforehand.\n\nHowever, some, like Norton, argue that the singularity is approximated in some sense that is useful, as the curve of the graph gets closer and closer to the one at N=infinity as N->infinity. The important point then is which property we consider.\n\n** Aharanov Bohm effect\n\nSomething about a solenoid in a magnetic field, which needs to be infinite in order for the calculation to make sense. Something something Berry shift.\n\n** FQHE\n\nThe classical hall effect is the phenomenon of measuring a transversal voltage when running a current through the long side of a metal plate, because of Lorentz afguiging. More electrons on the right then on the left, thus potential difference thus voltage.\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect has two sub parts: the integer and fractional quantum hall effect. Let us start with the former. The integer quantum hall effect is observed when running a similar experimental setup to the classical hall effect, but with a much thinner and purer sheet. This gives weird plateaus at integer multiples of the quantum of resitance?. The explanation for these plateaus is some weird stuff about Landau levels, but is ultimately not too surprising.\n\nThe Fractional Quantum hall effect is the weirder one. As the name suggests it is similar in appearance to the integer quantum hall effect, the difference being that the plateaus occur at fractional (1/3 etc) values of the quantum of resistance, rather than at the integer levels. This is rather suprising however, as the explanation for the integer hall effect does not allow there to be fractional quanta. Another explanation, then, is needed. The effect only occurs at even thinner and purer sheets as well. One of the two effects requires a not too pure sheet, cannnot rememver which\n\n\nThe relevant point here is that in order for the explanation of the fractional quantum hall effect (and possibly the integer one as well?) to get of the ground, we /need/ to assume that the configuration space of the electrons in the sheet is two dimensional. For the explanation depends on the fact that the fundamental symmetry group of the particles is Bn, not Sn. Bn is the fundamental group of 2D space, and small 3D space does not equal 2D space. This is an important difference and makes this example much clearer than the Thermodynamic Limit, as this is cool.\n\n** Breaking drops\n\nIn his 2005 paper Breaking Drops something something  cite:Batterman2005 argues that the breaking off of a droplet from a dripping faucet is an example of a genuine discontinuity in nature. While not mentioning the word \"infinite idealization\", it is clear that it was he is implying when making the argument.\n\nThe argument is flawed by using weird conceptions of continuity, in particular by taking the infinite limit before the end of the operation.\n\n* Part III: Discussion(s)\n\n(In this part I want to evaluate what I got out of my discussion of the case studies and generalize from there. These needn't be whole chapters, but it's useful for me to think of them as such for now.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210218153430"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"69945ee0"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"fermions.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"4f04-419b-8680-e45203302491"},{"count":24,"value":"][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210218153456"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"edcab4d4"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"bosons.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"3171-4b32-9833-451bfc53bafa"},{"count":218,"value":"][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210223152109"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"c2ab82ac"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"spin.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"8f25-4f9e-aabe-9fe53484c1d3"},{"count":199,"value":"][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210218152909"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"31cd49eb"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"anyons.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"770f-4d11-98b2-ca666b534201"},{"count":1629,"value":"][anyons]].\n\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\neg P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\lor \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all!

This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210219124712"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"b415c998"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"the_quantum_hall_effect_has_two_variations_integer_and_fractional.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"f7c4-4c1c-a83d-9b5225282514"},{"count":164,"value":"][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210219125647"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"96aec7c9"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"quantum_of_resistance.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"c31b-48da-9872-2690b057e7ca"},{"count":452,"value":"][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin.

Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct!

Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210223163548"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"1d52c1b9"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"6924-4272-9b33-a600b103240a"},{"count":24,"value":"][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210223163548"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"1d52c1b9"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"landau_states_have_a_large_degeneracy.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"6924-4272-9b33-a600b103240a"},{"count":1796,"value":"][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection?

However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210309161230"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"1d5f8392"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"iqhe_has_no_electron_interactions_fqhe_does.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"5e49-45b9-a998-e3b6636bff41"},{"count":29,"value":"][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210309161322"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"bd8b598f"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"reasoning_of_fqhe_is_less_rigorous_than_iqhe.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"7c03-4f61-a250-f408e437232c"},{"count":276,"value":"][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former.

Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection.

Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210511130045"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"af98c8b8"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"geometric_phase.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"d6d1-4443-893a-0a516b3664d2"},{"count":289,"value":"][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"phase_factor.org"},{"count":9,"added":true,"value":"6abcbdbc-c817-4688-be54-1a7c534af1fa"},{"count":965,"value":"][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210511110305"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"fd2450df"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"holonomy.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"e046-4d9c-a350-2be198e7fd04"},{"count":50,"value":"][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [["},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"file"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"id"},{"count":1,"value":":"},{"count":1,"removed":true,"value":"20210511111338"},{"count":1,"added":true,"value":"71b7fa31"},{"count":1,"value":"-"},{"count":3,"removed":true,"value":"parallel_transport.org"},{"count":7,"added":true,"value":"7712-4a3a-a3ff-825298ed86cd"},{"count":953,"value":"][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protagonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n** Geometry?

Kind of confusing.\n- Thermodynamic limit\n- Plane with low friction -> plane with lower friction ->...-> plane with no friction\n**** Direct\nIdealization in which the relevant parameter is directly set to zero or infinity or whatever, rather than using the limiting operation to influence this.\nThese are never problematic in the way described  below.\n- Plane with low friction -> plane with lower friction -> ... -> plane with no friction\n\n\n**** Indirect\nInfnite idealization in which some parameter is set to zero or infinity in order to set some other parameter to zero or non-zero.\n- Infinite population -> zero genetic drift (problematic)\n- (non-problematic example)\n- ???\n***** Problematic\nIndirect infinite idealization where the setting of a parameter to zero leads to a problem, but the idealization is still used (kind of a moot point since the only idealizations under serious study are those which are used in scientific practice, only counterexample is Norton's weird things)\n\n- Is the existence mismatch per se indirect?\n****** Existence mismatch\nProblematic indirect infinite idealization where the promotion fails because the infinite(simal) limit system does not exist, while we can imagine a property of such a system.\n+ Examples\n  - Ever increasing spheres. We can imagine that the surface/volume ratio of an infinite sphere is 1/r, but an infinite sphere does not exist\n  - FQHE: 2D electrons do not exist\n  - TDL: there are no infinite molecules, nor are molecules infinitely small\n  - AB effect: there are no infinite solenoids\n  - Population drift: there are no infinite populations\n\n+ Problems\n  - It is difficult to see what exactly \"the limit system does not exist\" means. Norton was relatively clear on that, but other authors have been less clear.\n******* Contradiction in terms (analytic)\nHere the problem arises because an infinitely small or big process/entity/model cannot exist per the definition of the thing. A sphere is defined by the equidistant points from a center, but points infinitely far away cannot meaningfully be said to be equidistant. Or points infinitely far away aren't points? Whatever.\n\nThis requires us to be quite strict with our definitions, something which physical models rarely are.\n******* Contradiction somewhere else, usually physical (synthetic)\n\nHere the problem arises not because the stipulated entity could not be imagined with a property set to zero or infinity, but because this would contradict something else. I feel like most problems discussed of actual idealizations used in physics are of this kind, as they seem to contradict something uncontrovertible.\n\nAs cite:Shech2013 points out, for this to work you also need to stipulate that the idealization is real in some sense in order to force a strong contradiction. One way to do this is by using an indispensability argument.\n\n+ Examples\n  - FQHE: problem is that actual electrons are not 2D\n  - AB: problem is that actual solenoids are not infinite\n  - TDL: problem is that actual systems do not contain infinite amounts of molecules\n  - Population drift: problem is that actual populations cannot be infinite, because too many?\n\nIf feel like we can distinguish /even further/ here, namely between idealizations which set a value to infinity vs those that set a value to zero. Maybe this is a higher category, but I feel like the ones that set stuff to zero could have a chance of not being physically problematic, because we can imagine that property not being there. That would then be either above or below existence mismatch, or above problematic maybe. However this would just move the categorty of problematic lower.\n\nBut, some things can get set to zero and cause a problem, such as FQHE where 3D dimension is set to zero. So then it would be indirect->zero -> nonproblem/problem -> existence mismatch whatever\n****** Discontinuous limit\nProblematic indirect infinite idealization where the promotion fails because the infinite limit does make sense (in some way) but that there is a dicontinuous jump in the property that is indirectly affected\n+ Examples\n  - Longer and longer ellipsoid becomes an infinitely long cylinder, but an infinitely long cylinder has a different surface to volume ratio than any of the ellipsoids.\n  - Thermodynamic heat transfer/reversible process.\n    A reversible process is an idealization of an infinitely slow process such that the system stays in equilibrium all the time. As the \"heat transfer time interval\" goes to zero all is well, but at 0 no heat can be transfered. Here an arbitrarily slow process works, but an infinitely slow one does not.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210204161139-you_can_only_generalize_if_you_have_sufficient_data.org","oid":"9bf7e217d5f45aa9c08e5b1e6461b7e95185d55e","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       d06eff85-7065-41af-b0e4-bb0720f7d4ec\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200844\n:ctime:    20210204161139\n:"},{"count":373,"value":"END:\n#+title: you can only generalize if you have sufficient data\n#+filetags: writing explanation thesis\n\n* Context\n\nTalk with Ronnie and Guido about my thesis.

We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a /characterization/, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[id:69945ee0-4f04-419b-8680-e45203302491][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[id:edcab4d4-3171-4b32-9833-451bfc53bafa][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[id:c2ab82ac-8f25-4f9e-aabe-9fe53484c1d3][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[id:31cd49eb-770f-4d11-98b2-ca666b534201][anyons]].\n\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\neg P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\lor \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\n# This might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n\n** Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons.

We turn on a constant magx I H V B, B pointing in the z-direction. Meanwhile, the electrons are restricted to move only in the (x, y)plane. A constant current I is made to flow in the x-direction. The Hall effect is the statement that this induces a voltage VH (H is for “Hall”) in the y-direction. This is shown in the figure= ref:chetong.\n#+caption: Classical Hall effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:chetong\n[[./media/chetong.png]]\n\nSince the voltage $V_H$ linearly depends on the Lorentz force, which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field $B$, $V_H$ linearly depends on $B$ and thus, classically, we expect the graph to look like Figure ref:linresistance. Similarly, we don't expect the resistance along the strip $\\rho_{xx}$ to vary either. =Bit more explanation for why we do not expect this=\n#+caption: caption Linear Resistance\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:linresistance\n[[./media/linresistance.png]]\n\nNote that for computational ease we are measuring and calculating the /resistivity/ along a certain axis rather than the voltage.\n\nHowever, as is often the case in physics, systems can behave rather differently from our classical expectations when put in extreme circumstances. These circumstances, in this case, include extremely low temperatures ($<2K$), strong magnetic fields ($>>1T$) and rather pure samples (but, as we shall see, not too pure either.)

These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[id:bce603cd-3eea-4dbc-b188-153845a24e16][Landau levels]]/, unsurprisingly first described by Landau, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task. =Badly written=\n\n\n# **** Quantization\n# Not necessary according to Guido, which I agree with\n#+begin_comment\n=I'm over explaining here=\nThe (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[id:db39298a-cd09-457c-b438-f369418c2be2][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[id:a4d107d5-467a-48b1-9385-e3348f07d049][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[id:41a6a097-12e9-4a05-a6f6-f496fdf515ff][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[id:56d07c1b-54da-4876-b7c5-6b7d0cc08fe2][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[id:2562a804-ec65-45e4-bae7-be73e0980e97][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[id:83d73e23-610d-4977-8106-c8b4c78ba0c7][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nAstute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\nAn additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n\n#+end_comment\n\n\n***  Integer vs Fractional\n\nThere are not one but two quantum Hall effects: the integer and the fractional. Both are explained by somewhat similar mechanisms, but only in the latter do we speak of anyons, so the FQHE will have our focus. However, it is worth briefly going over the integer version, as it provides some broad intuition for why the plateaux are at these points, and why there are plateaux in the first place. The integer explanation, however, will depend on two facts which necessarily do not apply to its fractional cousin: electron interaction are ignored, and the sample needs to be not too clean. Because of this first idealization, we are able to describe the IQHE much more rigorously than the FQHE as well.\n\n\n#+BEGIN_COMMENT\n[[id:b415c998-f7c4-4c1c-a83d-9b5225282514][the quantum hall effect has two variations, integer and fractional]]\n#+END_COMMENT\n**  The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n\n#+caption: The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe2.png]]\n\nThe *Integer Quantum Hall Effect* (IQHE), whose resistivity graph can be seen in ref:fig:iqhe, is the appearance of plateaux in the transversal resistivity of a conducting strip at integer multiples of the /[[id:96aec7c9-c31b-48da-9872-2690b057e7ca][quantum of resistance]]/    $R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi$, indicated by the $i$s in ref:fig:iqhe.\n\nThe IQHE has several other interesting features which will come into play later:\na) The location of the plateaux appears to be independent of the specific material\nb) The material must have some impurities, it cannot be \"too clean\"\nc) =The material must be rather thin. In fact, we take the material to be so thin that it becomes $2D$. This choice will come back to haunt us, but it is (for now) the only way of understanding the effect.=\n\n   Naturally, a physicist, after obtaining these results, would ask: why are these plateaux there? We can split this question into two subquestions:\n1. Why are there plateaux at all?\n2. Why are they at these regular, integer-multiple levels?\n\nUpon seeing ref:fig:iqhe, one might make a natural first guess to an answer to /2/  that these plateaux correspond to the different energy levels of the electrons of the system. In fact, one would be correct! While not trivial, it turns out that these plateaux correspond to the spectrum of a charged particle in a magnetic field, whose energy levels are called [[id:bce603cd-3eea-4dbc-b188-153845a24e16][Landau levels]]. Deriving these will be the first step to understanding the Quantum Hall Effect as a whole.\n\n***  Landau Levels\n\n=Our task is to solve for the spectrum and wavefunctions of the quantum Hamiltonian,\n$H 1 2m (p + eA)2$=\n\n=Since the particle is restricted to lie in the plane, we write x = (x, y). Meanwhile, we take the magnetic field to be constant and perpendicular to this plane, ∇ × A = Bˆ z.=\n\nTo make our lives somewhat easier, we define the /mechanical momentum/ to be\n\n\\[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} \\]\nwhich satisfy the commutation relations\n\\begin{equation}\n[\\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}}] = \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} - \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_y}} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi_x}}   = -ie\\hbar B\n    \\label{eq:momcom}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x − i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for π then tell us that a and a† obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n=which are precisely the commutation relations obeyed by the raising and lowering operators of the harmonic oscillator. Written in terms of these operators, the Hamiltonian (1.13) even takes the same form as that of the harmonic oscillator=\n\\[H= 1 2m π · π = ~ωB ( a†a + 1 2 )\\]\nwhere $ωB = eB/m$ =is the cyclotron frequency that we met previously (1.3). Now it’s simple to finish things off. We can construct the Hilbert space in the same way as the harmonic oscillator: we first introduce a ground state=|0〉 obeying ==== =a|0〉 = 0 and build the rest of the Hilbert space by acting with a†, a†|n〉 = √n + 1|n + 1〉 and a|n〉 = √n|n − 1〉 The state |n〉 has energy En = ~ωB ( n+ 1 2 ) n ∈ N (1.16) We learn that in the presence of a magnetic field, the energy levels of a particle become equally spaced, with the gap between each level proportional to the magnetic field B. The energy levels are called Landau levels. N==\n\n*Unlike the Harmonic oscillator, which concerns a $1D$ system with unique energy eigenstates, the Landau levels are not at all unique and extremely degenerate.*\n\n[[id:1d52c1b9-6924-4272-9b33-a600b103240a][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n#+transclude: t [[id:1d52c1b9-6924-4272-9b33-a600b103240a][Landau states have a large degeneracy]]\n\n\n**** Finding the Landaus\n\n     We have found /that/ the spectrum is discrete and that the eigenstates are widly degenerate, but we have not yet found a wavefunction nor energy for said eigenstates, which would be nice to have for saying anything concrete about the system.\n\n=To find wavefunctions corresponding to the energy eigenstates, we first need to specify a gauge potential A such that ∇ × A = Bˆ z There is, of course, not a unique choice. In this section and the next we will describe two different choices of A. In this section, we work with the choice A = xB ˆ y (1.17) This is called Landau gauge. Note that the magnetic field B is invariant under both translational symmetry and rotational symmetry in the (x, y)-plane. However, the choice of A is not; it breaks translational symmetry in the x direction (but not in the y direction) and rotational symmetry. This means that, while the physics will be invariant under all symmetries, the intermediate calculations will not be manifestly invariant. This kind of compromise is typical when dealing with magnetic field. The Hamiltonian (1.13) becomes H= 1 2m (p2 x + (py + eBx)2) Because we have manifest translational invariance in the y direction, we can look for energy eigenstates which are also eigenstates of py. These, of course, are just plane waves in the y direction. This motivates an ansatz using the=\n\nwith the Hamiltonian, we see that the operator py just gets replaced by its eigenvalue $\\hbar k$,\n\n\\[Hψk(x, y) = 1 2m (p2 x + (~k + eBx)2) ψx(x, y) ≡ Hkψk(x, y)\\]\n\nBut this is now something very familiar: it’s the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator in the x direction, with the centre displaced from the origin,\n\n\\[Hk = 1 2m p2 x + mω2 B 2 (x + kl2 B)2 \\]\n\n=The frequency of the harmonic oscillator is again the\ncyloctron frequency ωB = eB/m, and we’ve also introduced a length scale lB. This is a characteristic length scale which governs any quantum phenomena in a magnetic field. It is called the magnetic length. lB = √ eB To give you some sense for this, in a magnetic field of B = 1 Tesla, the magnetic length for an electron is lB ≈ 2.5 × 10−8 m. Something rather strange has happened in the Hamiltonian (1.19): the momentum in the y direction, ~k, has turned into the position of the harmonic oscillator in the x direction, which is now centred at x = −kl2 B. Just as in the algebraic approach above, we’ve reduced the problem to that of the harmonic oscillator. The energy eigenvalues are=\n\\begin{equation}\nE_n = \\hbar \\omega_B ( n+ \\frac{1}{2}  )\n    \\label{eq:landauee}\n\\end{equation}\n\n=But now we can also write down the explicit wavefunctions. They depend on two quantum numbers, n ∈ N and k ∈ R,=\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    ψn,k(x, y) ∼ eikyHn(x + kl2 B )e−(x+kl2 B )2/2l2 B (1.20)\n    \\label{eq:landauwfs}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwith $H_n$ the usual Hermite polynomial wavefunctions of the harmonic oscillator. The ∼ reflects the fact that we have made no attempt to normalise these these wavefunctions. The wavefunctions look like strips, extended in the y direction but exponentially localised around x = −kl2 =B in the x direction. However, the large degeneracy means that by taking linear combinations of these states, we can cook up wavefunctions that have pretty much any shape you like. Indeed, in the next section we will choose a different A and see very different profiles for the wavefunctions.=\n\n**** Does it check out?\n\n     So, what about our guess at the start of this subsection? Do the plateaux correspond to these energy levels?\n\n     Experimentally, we know that on one of these plateaux the transversal resistivity is\n     \\[\\rho_{xy} = \\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2} \\frac{1}{\\nu} \\]\n     $\\nu$ being the /i/s in Figure ref:fig:iqhe.\n\n     From our =rough calculation=, we expect that this conductivity depends on the densitiy of electrons $n$\n     \\[\\rho_{xy}=\\frac{B}{ne} \\]\n\n     Equating the two, we get\n     \\begin{equation}\n    n=\\frac{Be}{2\\pi\\hbar} \\nu\n    \\label{eq:landaufilling}\n\\end{equation}\nas the number of electrons in unit area.\n\nIf we can show that the degeneracy of a Landau level is the same, we would be reasonably assured that the plateaus $\\nu$ occur when a $\\nu$ Landau levels are exactly filled.\n=I HAVE NOT SHOWN ANYTHING=\n\n\n\n*** Why are the plateaux at those levels?\n\nEdge modes\n\n[[id:573dfbd0-2b6c-43b2-a08c-37f174de35c3][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n#+transclude: t [[id:573dfbd0-2b6c-43b2-a08c-37f174de35c3][edge modes determine the values of the IQHE plateaux]]\n\n*Edge modes are very important, but sound rather mysterious. However.*\n=The fact that something special happens along the edge of a quantum Hall system can be seen even classically. Consider particles moving in circles in a magnetic field. For a fixed magnetic field, all particle motion is in one direction, say anti-clockwise. Near the edge of the sample, the orbits must collide with the boundary. As all motion is anti-clockwise, the only option open to these particles is to bounce back. The result is a skipping motion in which the particles along the one-dimensional boundary move  only in a single direction, as shown in the figure. A particle restricted to move in a single direction along a line is said to be chiral. Particles move in one direction on one side of the sample, and in the other direction on the other side of the sample. We say that the particles have opposite chirality on the two sides. This ensures that the net current, in the absence of an electric field, vanishes=. *This way we can retain a rather simple model*\n\n*Chirality is an interesting property in its own right*\n=Having a chiral mode is rather special. In fact, there’s a theorem which says that you can’t have charged chiral particles moving along a wire; there has to be particles which can move in the opposite direction as well. In the language of field theory, this follows from what’s called the chiral anomaly. In the language of condensed matter physics, with particles moving on a lattice, it follows from the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem. The reason that the simple example of a particle in a magnetic field avoids these theorems is because the chiral fermions live on the boundary of a two-dimensional system, rather than in a one-dimensional wire. This is part of a general story: there are physical phenomena which can only take place on the boundary of a system. This story plays a prominent role in the study of materials called topological insulators=.\n*While chiral modes might be an interesting object of study, we wont be focussing on it in much detail.*\n\n\n=A second reason why chiral modes are special is that it’s hard to disrupt them. If you add impurities to any system, they will scatter electrons. Typically such scattering makes the electrons bounce around in random directions and the net effect is often that the electrons don’t get very far at all. But for chiral modes this isn’t possible simply because all states move in the same direction. If you want to scatter a left-moving electron into a right-moving electron then it has to cross the entire sample. T= *This way the whole system is rather stable*\n\n*How then do we use these facts to calculate the conductivitiy?*\n=Let’s now look at what happens when we fill the available states. We do this by introducing a chemical potential. The states are labelled by y-momentum  but, as we’ve seen, this can equally well be thought of as the position of the state in the x-direction. This means that we’re justified in drawing the filled states like this: EF x V(x) From our usual understanding of insulators and conductors, we would say that the bulk of the material is an insulator (because all the states in the band are filled) but the edge of the material is a metal. We can also think about currents in this language. We simply introduce a potential difference ∆μ on the two sides of the sample. This means that we fill up more states on the right-hand edge than on the left-hand edge, like this: EF EF To compute the resulting current we simply need to sum over all filled states. But, at the level of our approximation, this is the same as integrating over x Iy = −e ∫ dk 2π vy(k) = e 2πl2 B ∫ dx 1 eB ∂V ∂x = e 2π ∆μ (2.4) The Hall voltage is eVH = ∆μ, giving us the Hall conductivity σxy = Iy VH = e2 2π~ (2.5) which is indeed the expected conductivity for a single Landau level.= *Nice innit*\n\n\n\n***  Wait... why are there plateaux anyways?\n\n    The explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\n    This is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness. \n\n    Experimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n    1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n    2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:disorder\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\n#+caption: Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended\n\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\n    |\\Delta V|<<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} \n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.= \n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=. \n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see textcite:Tong2016   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n** TODO FQHE in depth\n\n    There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\nThe Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n \n*** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t [[id:1d5f8392-5e49-45b9-a998-e3b6636bff41][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n\n#+transclude: t [[id:bd8b598f-7c03-4f61-a250-f408e437232c][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n*** TODO The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\n It would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n\n*** TODO Finding the wavefunction\n\n [[id:2517c712-c625-4cd3-9d8e-93b37baeeac6][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n#+transclude: t [[id:2517c712-c625-4cd3-9d8e-93b37baeeac6][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n\n While you might think that quantum mechanics is easy[fn:2], it is actually rather difficult to solve the equations of systems barely larger than a Helium atom. In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[id:607655ae-3263-4bd2-a03f-b4b877e42c1f][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\n Do this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n \"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality ref:eq:perturbation to hold.\n\n Ideally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n*** TODO Writing down the LWF\n\n This problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\n While this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n  Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\n To see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n where, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[id:b9c034ae-c43c-488b-8c96-996789ac2695][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n \\begin{equation}\n \\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n     \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n \\end{equation}\n (note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\n The handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n \\[\n \\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n \\]\n If we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n . However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\n Now, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\n To get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[id:c1fb832a-c00d-48d5-8397-1cdd1f7617df][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[id:3dad96b9-a6bf-449f-981e-4e141f865dd5][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[id:75068634-a939-42ae-815f-8c31d02cf5f5][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[id:5441a486-c826-424d-a30a-e08b9208642b][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Geometric Anyon phase\n\n Above we have seen the /topological/ explanation for the anyon phase, but, clearly, it leaves something to be desired: the idealization of 2D space/simply connectedness is too strong, demanding us to change the way we look at the world completely. Furthermore, it is not exactly satisfying, as while it does provide some base level explanation for the effect, it introduces another mystery similar to the Aharonov-Bohm Effect: either we have a real experiment instantiatiating a fictitious system, or we have no explanation for when exactly anyons would show up.\n\nThat is why we have been looking at the FQHE up until now, as this is one of the areas where the anyonic phase is said to show up. Moreover, the FQHE gives us the physical tools to calculate the phase in a different way: geometrically.\n\n** Geometric phase explanation\n\n   Although not everyone agrees, the AB effect can for instance be explained geometrically rather than topologically. With this I mean that the phase arises because of /geometric features/ such as curvature rather than out of /topological features/ such as the connectedness. Topological explanation discard all features with are not topologically invariant, which are the features of a space that remain the same under homeomorphisms. This is partially what leads to the mystery of the anyonic phase, as topological explanations, dealing only with objects that \"can be continuously deformed into each other\" are rather \"all or nothing\": ALL loops can either be deformed to a point or not.\n\n   Luckily there is a possibility to calculate the phase geometrically, through the aptly named [[id:af98c8b8-d6d1-4443-893a-0a516b3664d2][Geometric Phase]]. The geometric phase is based on the geometry (\"curvature\") rather than the topology (\"connectedness\") of the space we will be able to calculate a phase with a continuous dependence on some parameters, rather than the discrete dependence on the connectedness in the topological explanation.\n\n*** Brief history\n\nTheoretical phases have studied geometric phases since around the 1950s, most prominently by  Parachtnam and Kato who showed that ... something with light.\n\n    Howeventually cite:Berry1984.\n\n*** What is phase\n\n    A quantum system, being represented by a wave function, can just like regular ol' sinus waves be described in terms of its amplitude, period, and /phase/, which is, crudely put, the offset with respect to the origin. In quantum mechanics this is almost always described using the [[id:6abcbdbc-c817-4688-be54-1a7c534af1fa][Phase factor]] $e^{i\\theta}$.\n\n    A simple illustration will help.\n\n    Say our fictional quantum mechanical system is described as $\\psi(x,t)=\\sin(x-t2\\pi)$. After evolving for $t=0.25$, it will always acquire a /dynamical/ phase factor related to time.\n\n    # Normally this is related to the energy but for now it isn't because we haven't defined.\n\n    At $x=0$, $\\psi(t=0)=0$, while at $\\psi(t=0.25)=1$. We can express this using the phase factor $e^{i\\theta}$, with $\\theta=1/4\\pi$, which we can write as\n    \\[\\psi(t=0.25)=e^{i\\pi/2}\\psi(t=0)=e^{i\\pi/4}sin(x)=.......\\]\n\n    The point is that we can generally do this, that the phase factor is dependent on time alone.\n\n*** Geometrical phase\n\n    Berry (and others) discovered that, under certain conditions, this dynamical phase factor is not the /only/ contribution to the total phase, but the state also acquires a /geometrical phase factor/, which, as the name suggests, is due to the geometry of something. The most straightforward \"thing\" whose geometry would influence phase would be the geometry of spacetime itself, but actually it's much more general than that.\n\n    In general, we say that a quantum state picks up a geometrical phase factor when it is transported /adiabatically/ from one point in parameter space to another. This means that we do things very slowly such as not to make the state go into a different eigenstate. With /parameter space/ we mean the space of all possible values some parameter of the Hamiltonian can take. This can be many different things, we just have to make sure to move everything slowly so the system remains in the same eigenstate.\n\n    Some examples for these parameters include position, the strength of an external magnetic field, the specific settings for a Stern-Gerlach measuring apparatus, the direction of an electric field, etc. The easiest to visualize and most important for our purposed is the physical position of the particles, as the path in parameter space then simply is the path the particles take in physical space, and since the phase we are studying is the phase particles pick up under exchange, which happens in real space.\n\n*** How does geometrical phase get there\n\nAs Berry said in his original paper, the occurence of the geometrical phase does indeed appear quite \"magical\"cite:Berry1984. However, as cite:Simon1983 soon thereafter elucidated, the Berry phase becomes a whole lot less mysterious once we link it to a more general geometric property: [[id:fd2450df-e046-4d9c-a350-2be198e7fd04][Holonomy.]]\n\nHolonomy is the phenomenon of a vector (or more generally any mathematical object) not remaining completely invariant after being [[id:71b7fa31-7712-4a3a-a3ff-825298ed86cd][Parallel transport]]ed along some curved surface. An example is in order.\n\nSay you are at the northpole, looking \"south\" (every direction is south) along the Greenwhich meridian line. Your field of vision (let's just take the center of it for simplicity) is our vector which we will be parallel transporting. It has a length of approximately 5km (this does not really matter) and is facing wherever you are looking, originating wherever you are standing. We will now only change one of these variables gradually, your position. You start to bravely swim along this meridian, eventually reaching the equator. Since you are already making a fool's journey, you figure you might as well lean into it and add an extra condition: you will never turn during your journey. Meaning that once you reach the equator, instead of turning 90 degrees to face East, you shuffle Eastword across Africa like some sort of stray crab. Once you reach the international date line in the Pacific ocean, you do not stop acting the fool and begin imitating the jellyfish you meet there, swimming backwards on your back in a straight line back to your starting point.\n\nOnce you have been certain you returned back to the same spot again, the question now is: which direction are you facing? Given that you never turned around, you might have expected to face England once again. However, to your utter dismay you are still staring down that boring international date line, ocean as far you could see. Despite never turning around, you have ended up turning $180^\\circ$ nonetheless! Curse you, geometry!\n\nThis extra angle that you picked up on your Oddyssey is a/has something to do with *holonomy*. Holonomy is a rather general property, but in general indicated the failure of parallel transport along a certain manifold, in this case the 2-Sphere (in normal people talk: the surface of a sphere). While this may be shocking to our foolhardy protagonist, there is something deeply intuitive about not ending up facing the same direction here. But being intuitive does not mean easy to explain: all we know for now  that this has something to do with the curvature of the space we are traversing, but .[fn:4]\n\n\n\nThese two questions and answers are rather handy, and they cite the following two papers as useful\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/383281/when-is-the-berry-phase-only-dependent-on-path-topology\n\nhttps://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/235503/why-is-the-phase-picked-up-during-identical-particle-exchange-a-topological-inva?rq=1\n\ncite:Leinaas1977\ncite:Knapp2016\n\n\n\n** Geometry?

If this limit would not have been smooth (it fortunately is), we would have wasted all this time!  \n\n[fn:5] Improved performance of impure 2D materials is an active area of research in material science, see cite:Wang2020 for a summary of how impurities enhance the conductivity of graphene. \n[fn:4] Instead imagine taking this same journey in your backyard: walking 5 steps foward, then walking 5 steps with a ninety degree angle to your left, then walking 5 steps back.

Is there even a good explanation there?\n*** [ ] In how much details should I treat non-abelian anyons?\n* The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\n\n** Part I (Brief, <4k): The motivation for looking at the FQHE gets explained, namely the fact that something appears to be explained with an infinite idealization, with reference to my introduction and Shech's article,\n\n*** a. /b/ The FQHE is briefly introduced, namely the weird bumps and a hint of mentioning anyons and that the reason for this is that the config space is 2D\n\n\n*** b. /a/ This 2D explanation is identified as an infinitesimal idealization, one which has been claimed to play a key role in the /explanation/ of the effect, and explanation => existence. It should be clear how weirdly different this explanation is from other more common ones, such as classical ones. Also it should be emphasized how universal this explanation is, such as the fact that the location of the bumps does not even depend on the material.\n\n\n*** c. It is argued that if this explanation would succeed in the way described above, we would have a reasonable case for an actual sectioning off of reality? Here it must be clear why this effect is so useful to study, but also what I will do when it does not turn out to be so dramatic, i.e. how I will generalize\n\n** Part II (Long, ~10k): The details of the FQHE are laid bare, with little interpretation going on in order for the actual \"explanation\" of the effect to be as clear as possible, mostly based on Tong\n\n*** d. The groundwork needed for the explanation to get things of the ground is laid: the CHE is explained in more detail, Landau levels are introduced and the distinction between the Integer and Fractional QHE is clarified, and the former is (for now) made clear to be less important to explain\n\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n*****  To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[id:bce603cd-3eea-4dbc-b188-153845a24e16][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n*****  Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting a vibe of the thing\n\n***** Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n...\n\n**** Quantization\n\n***** The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it. The rough steps required are to first compute the [[id:db39298a-cd09-457c-b438-f369418c2be2][Lagrangian]] of the classical system, use that to compute its [[id:a4d107d5-467a-48b1-9385-e3348f07d049][Hamiltonian]], from which we can derive the [[id:41a6a097-12e9-4a05-a6f6-f496fdf515ff][Poisson Brackets]]. Then, we treat the Hamiltonian as if it were quantum, use the Poisson Brackets as the [[id:56d07c1b-54da-4876-b7c5-6b7d0cc08fe2][Canonical Commutation Relation,]] rewrite the Hamiltonian in a form we understand (as always, the [[id:2562a804-ec65-45e4-bae7-be73e0980e97][Harmonic Oscillator]]), and use that Hamiltonian to construct the [[id:83d73e23-610d-4977-8106-c8b4c78ba0c7][Hilbert Space]] from which we can read the energy levels. Sounds simple enough, right?\n\n\n***** First, let us recap the Lagrangian of a particle in a magnetic field.\n$L = T - V$\n$T=1/2 m\\dot{x}^2$\n$V = e \\dot{x}\\cdot \\textbf{A}$\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    L=\\frac{1}{2}m \\dot{\\textbf{x}}^{2}-e \\dot{\\textbf{x}}\\cdot \\textbf{A}\n    \\label{eq:lagrmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n*****  From here we can derive the Hamiltonian\n\\[H= \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\cdot \\textbf{P} -L = \\dot{\\textbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\textbf{x}}} - L = .....    \\]\n\\begin{equation}\n   H = \\frac{1}{2m} (\\textbf{p} + e \\textbf{A})^{2}\n    \\label{eq:classHamMag}\n\\end{equation}\n\n***** Using the Hamiltonian it is easy to derive the Poisson Bracket structure.\nLittle sidenote about why that is important.\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{F(x,y),G(x,y)\\}=\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}\n    \\label{eq:poissonbrackets}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\{x_i, p_j\\}=\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with    } \\{x_i,x_j\\}=\\{p_i,p_j\\}=0\n    \\label{eq:poissonmag}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCoool\n\n\n*****  Now we can move on to the quantum side, which means we can take over \\ref{eq:magham} and substitute the functions for quantum operators.\nOperators are functions which spit out other functions, rather than a scalar or vector.\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2m}(\\hat{\\textbf{p}} + e \\hat{\\textbf{A}} )^{2}\n    \\label{eq:quantumMagHam}\n\\end{equation}\n\nWe take Gauge $\\nabla \\times \\hat{\\textbf{A}}= B \\hat{z}$\n\nAnd get canonical commutation relations\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    [x_i, p_j]=i\\hbar\\delta_{ij} \\text{   with   } [x_i, x_j]=[p_i,p_j]=0\n    \\label{eq:ccr}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThen we do raising lowering, find the hamiltonian and then\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    E_n=\\hbar\\omega_B \\Big(n+\\frac{1}{2} )\\quad n \\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:landaulevels}\n\\end{equation}\n\nTada\n\n**** Important details and idealizations\n\n***** Astute readers might have noticed that, suprisingly, the spin of the particles has not been mentioned once so far! This is because we can relatively safely neglect it as a good approximation, as the effect of spin on the energy states smoothly becomes less and less prominent the higher the strength of the magnetic field is.\n\n***** An additionally seemingly important detail is the fact that the Hall System is taken to be in 2D from the start.\n[[id:c1a2779f-73d4-491e-8d7b-02f04dd20776][The dimensions of the Hall system is set to 2 from the start]]\n\n\n*** e. The FQHE is set up in more detail, with the goal of making clear which idealizing assumptions are made, such as the LWF, the plasma analogy and why the toy model is needed. It is again emphasized that the FQHE is explained more in a \"making plausible\" way rather than a \"derivation way\", and seeds are planted as to what this will imply for the kind of explanation (not DN) under study\n\n**** Dawdling\n***** Now that we have developed a base-level understandig of the (quantum) mechanics at play in the effect in general, it is time to turn our attention to the matter at hand: understanding the Quantum Hall system.\n\n\n***** I don't want to look at the IQHE too much, as while it is interesting, its explanation does not require nearly the same idealizations as its fractional counterpart.\n\n***** However, some of the lessons learned from the effect do prove useful, such as why the plateaux a) have the value they have and b) why the plateaux persist over a wideish range of magnetic field strengths.\n\n***** There are two difficulties however with using lessons from the IQHE in the fqhe effect\n****** The Integer explanation relies on the fact that there are (small) impurities in the sample. However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n****** The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n\n***** For those reasons we will be skipping a thorough examination of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect and jump straight into the FQHE\n\n**** FQHE\n\n***** The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\n****** Perhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer Counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same ~ballpark~ solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\n****** It would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n- [[id:2517c712-c625-4cd3-9d8e-93b37baeeac6][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n- [[id:39621947-ed87-43ad-86d6-14a5e4f2b8c2][The FQH State Is Interpreted as a Plasma to Allow for Intuitions and Computation]]\n- The LWF is not even an actual ground state of the FQH Hamiltonian, instead from it we derive a Toy Hamiltonian of which the LWF is the ground state, bringing us even further from our goal.\n\n-[[id:23e0cf04-bd7f-4c24-bdd0-7f65dea6df6b][Fractional Statistics can Only be Calculated Using Adiabaticity]]\n****** Using these assumptions/idealizations however, we can make it plausible that FQ statistics are happening, I don't think we will use much more.\n\n****** The wavefunction under consideration is called the Laughlin Wave Function, thought up by >>Laughlin in 1983 after the experimental observation of the FQHE in 1982 by ...\n\n****** Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small.

The Fractional Statistics are derived using the Berry Connection, making clear the similarities here with the Aharonov Bohm effect.

It is made clear that the explanation given by me is much less committal yet accomplishes the same thing, namely an account of how anyons behave. If phase transitions are treated before this, I can contrast the \"purity\" of my explanation with that above, as we do not even lose the universal behavior.\n\n\n*** i. From h. it becomes clear that some kind of fallacy is committed when putting forth the explanation of Shech, but this is not worked out in detail as that will be the topic of the next chapter, leaving readers begging for more content.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210403183452-simply_connected.org","oid":"e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391","diff":[{"count":50,"added":true,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       2e0a3a59-3794-4b5f-8313-f630d88a7a87\n:mtime:    20210701195324\n:ctime:    20210403183452\n:END:\n#+title: Simply connected\n#+filetags: definition topology\n"}],"additions":20,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210403184145-abelian_group.org","oid":"b6793dfa29f39e5f0e70c45e411c108107a036ea","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       dbe6233d-e0e1-4f89-9f93-ae30a1664cb4\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200755\n:ctime:    20210403184145\n:"},{"count":133,"value":"END:\n#+title: Abelian group\n#+filetags: definition \"group theory\"\n\nAn *Abelian group* is a [[id:0bbb9ce7-191f-4fde-8924-cad8a3886e2e][Group]]  $G={f_1,...,f_i,...; \\ocircle}$ whose multiplication operation is [[id:513da0c5-b2e5-4e32-b18c-ab765901f913][Commutative]], i.e.\n\n\\[\\forall i,j \\quad f_i \\ocircle f_j = f_j \\ocircle f_i\\]\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210407150939-structure_fqhe_anyon_chapter.org","oid":"4c275e4e1ebeaf9425042f4651c58bd3e65ebabf","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       40453cb7-ee57-42b9-8180-cb973ce219c3\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200754\n:ctime:    20210407150939\n:"},{"count":10552,"value":"END:\n#+title: Structure FQHE/anyon chapter\n#+filetags: chapter anyons FQHE\n# #+startup: latexpreview\n\n# #+latex_header: \\documentclass{tufte-book}\n#+latex_header: \\usepackage{braket}\n\n* The Fractional quantum hall effect and its discontents\n\n# convince the reader that what you're saying is worthwhile\n\nSo, now that we have gained a high-level idea of idealizations, the question is: which idealizations are worth looking at? We have seen some standard examples such as air resistance, but those turned out to be easily understood as approximations rather than idealizations, for when we want to predict the velocity of a falling ball it does not really matter whether there is no air resistance or $0$ air resistance, so we can freely move between (demote and promote) the idealized model (the ball falling in a vacuum) and the approximate propositions about our actual system (for the first seconds of the fall of the ball its speed $\\approx gt$).\n\nWe must keep in mind, however, that whether an idealization proves problematic depends not only on the specific model constructed, but crucially on the specific properties we are idealizing (away) and what properties of the target system we care about preserving. In the case of the ball, we are primarily interested in its velocity, which is (at least for the first few seconds) only marginaly affected by the idealization.\n\nImagine instead another researcher, Andreas, who is a bit of an odd fellow. Andreas does not care in the least what the velocity of the ball is, it's all the same to them. What Andreas /is/ interested in is whether the ball will continue to accelerate indefenitely or whether the ball will reach a stable velocity at some point, whatever that may be, Andreas doesn't care. For Andreas, this model would not at all do as an idealization, as the ball falling in air resistance will never reach a stable velocity, always accelerating, accelerating...\n\nTherefore, it might not seem wise to argue in detail about what the status of any given statement, equation or theory /is/, as one man's approximation is another man's idealization. The whole field of study could perhaps just be summed up with \"it depends\", another philosophical debate has been explained away and Wittgensteinians around the world rejoice.\n\nAs big of a fan of ol' Ludwig I am, I do think there is sufficient reason not to treat this as just another language game and that at the very least there are some unexplored areas left to explore. Two possibilities lie before us. Firstly we could argue that a hard distinction /can/ be made between idealizations and approximations. For one, Norton explicitly claimed that his distinction was not meant as the be all end all definition of both terms, but merely a ~characterization~, which, while a fair description of Norton's work here, does seem like the philosopher's equivalent of a Youtuber claiming \"no copyright infringement intended\" after using a Metallica song in their intro: you might not want people to take it a certain way, but you should have expected they would.\n\nHowever, even disregarding Norton's disclaimer, it does not quite feel in the spirit of this thesis to attempt to construct a rigorous distinction between two sketchy, dare I say \"vague\" concepts. Instead, to somewhat placate those pesky Wittgensteinians, I will go for the second option, namely to discuss a purported idealization in which the property under question is such that we all agree to care about the outcome of our scrutinizing: the very existence of the system/property/... to begin with! And what could be more interesting (to physicists, and therefore the world) than the existence of  a whole class of new particles?\n\n** Anyons\n\nAnyons are a theorized and alledgedly observed new type of particles. Up until their theorizing/observation, physics squarely placed particles in two types: [[id:69945ee0-4f04-419b-8680-e45203302491][fermions]] such as electrons, neutrinos and quarks, and [[id:edcab4d4-3171-4b32-9833-451bfc53bafa][bosons]] such as photons, protons and the Higgs particle. What unites all these particles is that if you have two of them, they are /indistinguishable/ from one another, meaning that when you find yourself in the unenviable position of calculating with more than one particle, you have to account for the fact that it is /impossible/ to keep the two apart. We call this \"accounting for\" /phase/, which we multiply with the state of the system anytime we exchange the two particles.  By the spin-statistics theorem, the phase of a particle also tells us something about their [[id:c2ab82ac-8f25-4f9e-aabe-9fe53484c1d3][spin]].[fn:3]  \"Thus\" we have fermions with spin of integer multiples of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and bosons with integer spin.\n\nWe will see why this is the case in a second, but the important disclaimer to the above result is that it only holds in $3D$ and higher. There exists a way to get around the inevitability of two types of particles in $2D$, such that we can show that there could be particles which have different statistics and could take on /any/ spin, aptly named [[id:31cd49eb-770f-4d11-98b2-ca666b534201][anyons]].\n\nWhat makes them interesting as a case study here is that the commonly accepted explanation for anyons states that they are not able to exist in 3 dimensions, only being possible in 2 dimensions. This is very intersting, because the world we know is 3D, how can it possibly be that these particles are 2D?\n\nThe reason this is especially interesting is that were this to be so, we would have a very clearly observable case of a discontinuous change of a very continuous parameter: the crossing of the boundary between 2D and 3D. This boundary crossing has a couple of different qualities that make it an excellent case study\n\n1. The change is rather dramatic: getting rid of a whole dimension is no easy feat.\n2. The explanation for anyons is somewhat controversial, meaning that there is a lot of different viewpoints\n3. The difficulty of this problem is usually waved away by physicists by saying that the problem is actually just /effectively 2D/, meaning that the system is 3D but just behaves in a 2D fashion. This is usually not substantiated much, however.\n\nRemember the main trilemma we find ourselves in when discussing such a boundary. If we have a binary property dependent on a continuously varying parameter, we (or so I wish to show) have one of three choices for drawing a line\n1. The parameter $x$ is not a continuous but a discrete parameter. This allows us to draw the line with arbitrary precision somewhere\n2. The  parameter $x$ is continuous, and either $\\not P$ or $P$ is true $\\forall x$\n3. The parameter $x$ is continuous and we do not really care about whether $P \\or \\not P$ is /really/ true, nor care about where the line is really drawn, we just have cases where the line is definitely drawn and once where it is unclear. We give up the binary nature of $P$.\n\nThe case of the anyon presents itself as either 2/3 (The system is not 2D but 3D and effectively 2D) or as one which falls outside of these categorizations, that is: it's interesting. The former is what physicists usually argue but do not practice (they do not provide an adequate characterization, as I shall show) while the latter is the argument made by  cite:Shech2019, which I will examine in great detail in the rest of this chapter.\n\nThis might still annoy some but I don't care this is enough warmup.\n\n\n\nThat's whats at stake in the qhe, between 2d and 3d\n\n** 1.4 Sorry, what was this about the quantum hall effect again?\n\nThe astute reader may have noticed that we have not yet referred to the title of this chapter at all! What is this quantum hall effect?\n\nThis is true: anyons were independently theorized by .... in 1978, and their existence in 2D can be predicted using merely topological\n\nI will argue in the\n\nThe FQHE does not per se rely on anyons for its explanation, rather it shows that the mechanism which gives rise to the effect are anyonic interactions.\n\nI argue that we cannot look at the way anyons are theorized through constructing configuration spaces without looking at how this might physically manifest itself in the lab.\n\nOne objection to this reasoning is that it would bias the investigation in \"my\" favor, namely that I would think the explanation to be unsatisfactory regardless because we cannot manifest (such) a 2D system in a 3D world. This is a fair concern, so I propose a \"bet\" of sorts: if I am not able to find and alternative characterization of how effective 2D systems would give rise to anyons, I will accept that the system is exactly and not approximately 2D.\nHaving 2D systems, while not fitting in our current worldview as snugly as I would like, would open the door to a lot of interesting new physics.\n\nOn the other hand, if I do succeed in providing an agreeable characterization of effective 2D, then this would deepen our understanding of such effects much more, open up that black box so to say, and perhaps allow us to more easily construct such systems later due to our deepened understanding.\n\n=JUSTIFY BETTER=\nFinally, I wish to address the quantum hall effect itself /first/, before diving into the purported explanation of anyons. If we were to examine the anyons first .....\n\n* The quantum hall effect\n** Once again, what is it\n*** Classical Hall effect\n\n[[id:8fc72829-7ad9-4c8a-b400-229add0957bb][classical hall effect]]\n\n*** Preliminaries\n**** What do we want!? \"Quantization!\" When do we want it!? \"After gaining a thorough understanding of why it is necessary!\"\n\n To understand the QHE, we must first grasp the fundamental mechanism through which it can arise in the first place, namely the quantization of energy states of electrons when subject to a constant magnetic field. These specific energy eigenstates are called /[[id:bce603cd-3eea-4dbc-b188-153845a24e16][Landau levels]]/, and deriving and gaining a general understanding of them will be our first task.\n\n Note that the existence of these energy levels is neither trivial nor unsurprising: a free particle (such as (roughly) one normally found in a strip of metal) is not quantized.\n\n**** Getting an idea of things\n\n Before doing so, it is useful to describe the CHE in more detail, as while the description given earlier about the potential difference arising from a Lorentz force makes intuitive sense, it is not nearly rigorous enough to allow us to derive the QHE. What we want at this stage is an expression for the transversal and longitudinal conductance, from which we can plot the expected classical potential difference vs the strenght of the magnetic field.\n\n**** Quantization\n\n The (literal) textbook approach we will follow here is describing the classical system first and then quantizing it.

However, we know that the FQHE only occurs when the sample is /very/ pure, so the explanation in both cases will likely be different\n The explanation of the IQHE purposefully neglects the interactions electrons have with each other, which is a) unrealistic and b) unneglectable when talking about the FQHE, as it plays a key role in lifting the degeneracy of the Landau states.\n\n For those reasons we will be skipping a thorough examination of the Integer Quantum Hall Effect and jump straight into the FQHE\n\n* FQHE in depts\n** Adding electron interaction\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[id:1d5f8392-5e49-45b9-a998-e3b6636bff41][IQHE has no electron interactions, FQHE does]]\n\n#+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n[[id:bd8b598f-7c03-4f61-a250-f408e437232c][reasoning of FQHE is less rigorous than IQHE]]\n\n** The Ugly: Idealizations, Idealizations Everywhere\n\nPerhaps the most striking difference in the derivation of the FQHE as opposed to the IQHE is the rigour of reasoning used in the former. Unlike its Integer counterpart, the \"explanation\" much less resembles, well, a derivation, and is better characterized as a \"motivation\" instead, using a combination of handwaving, squinting at equations and plain stubbornness to finally get a result which is in the same ~ballpark~ solar system as what we would imagine an proper explanation to be.\n\nIt would do us well to list the most egregious ones first, so they are not able to sneak up on us in the end.\n\n** Finding the wavefunction\n\n#+transclude: t hlevel: 5\n[[id:2517c712-c625-4cd3-9d8e-93b37baeeac6][The wavefunction of the FQHE is GUESSED from general grounds]]\n\nWhile you might think that quantum mechanics is easy[fn:2], it is actually rather difficult to solve the equations of systems barely larger than a Helium atom. In fact, for most systems we cannot even write down the wavefunction, much less show how it will evolve. The standard solution to these problems is to use  [[id:607655ae-3263-4bd2-a03f-b4b877e42c1f][perturbation theory]] to find something reasonably close to the actual wavefunction. This works by guessing some test-wavefunction, have it interact with the Hamiltonian plus some slight perturbation, and then ....\nDo this a couple of times and we get reasonably close to the actual wavefunction of the system: a true approximation in the Nortonian sense.\n\n\"Alright\", you say, dumbfounded \"I guess that's alright. Kind of dissapointing that we don't have the 'actual wavefunction', but I can live with it.\" Luckily for us, we will not have to settle for the perturbed wavefunction, as we cannot even use perturbation theory here! Recall the insidious italics above: perturbation theory has us treat the disturbance as a /small/ disruption. If we poke the system slightly, we expect it to go relax back to the same state again, which is what allows the above equality \\eqref{eq:perturbation} to hold.\n\nIdeally we would want to use the Hamiltonian of the IQHE and perturb it a little in order to account for the effects of \"turning on\" the electron interactions. But the electron interaction cannot be modeled as a small perturbation, *as it's too big*: remember that the Landau levels are /wildly/ degenerate, so any additional term is going to multilply considerably, $10^{23}$ considerably. So what now?\n\n** Writing down the LWF\n\nThis problem was 'solved' by Laughlin in 1982, by instead of even attempting to do the tedious mathematics, he simply wrote down \"the\" wavefunction of the system. The scare-quotes are not for show this time, as the Laughlin Wavefunction cannot by any measure be said to be the actual one describing the system. Instead, the argument goes, it describes a system which is in the same /equivalence class/ of the actual system. *HOW DO WE KNOW THAT*\n\nWhile this may sound silly, Laughlin did not just pull it out of thin air, instead it is more of an educated guess, one which makes some sense.\n\n\n Wavefunction is not derived analytically, because hard, and not through perturbation theory because with 10^11 particles perturbations are not small. Instead it is guessed and shown to be similar enough to the actual WF to be useful.\n$N=\\frac{AB}{\\phi_0}e^-$\n$\\hbar\\omega_B >> E_{cont}>>V_{disorder}$\nThe Laughlin WF only applies to the filling fractions of $\\nu=\\frac{1}{m}$\n\n*** Step one is admitting you have a problem\n\n How is it guessed?

The key insight that leads to the connection between the two is demonstrating that the quasi-holes and quasi-particles have /fractional charge/ and, finally, fractional statistics. To actually prove that we need to introduce something else entirely, the Berry Phase, but before doing so it is worth it to go through a less technical explanation for why these holes would have fractional charge.\n\nTo see this, let us return to the hole wavefunction\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{hole}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}(z_i-\\eta)\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:holeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere, once again, $m$ is the inverse of the [[id:b9c034ae-c43c-488b-8c96-996789ac2695][filling factor]]  $\\nu=1/m$ and $\\eta$ the position of the hole. We can generalize this a wavefunction with $M$ holes, as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\Psi_{M-holes}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{j=1}^M\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta_j)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n    \\label{eq:mholeLWF}\n\\end{equation}\n(note the added exponent after the $z_i-\\eta_i$ term)\n\nThe handwavey explanation goes as follows. Say we ignore the Pauli-exclusion principle for as second (as we do not yet know if that even holds for these holes) and we place all of the holes $M$ at one position $\\eta$. The wavefunction for this system would look identical to \\ref{eq:LWFhole}, except for the added exponent (which you of course noted), like so\n\n\\[\n\\Psi_{holes-in-one-spot}^\\eta(z)=\\prod_{i=1}^N(z_i-\\eta)^m\\prod_{k<l}(z_k-z_l)^m e^{-\\sum_{i=1}^n \\abs{z_i}^2/{4l_B^2}}\n\\]\nIf we squint our eyes a bit, the parameter $\\eta$ could look like a variable instead, describing a particle rather than simply a position of the hole(s). If that is the case, however, $\\eta$ would just work like another $z_l$ , an electron of charge $-e$\n. However, since it's not, we can infer that it's simply the normal Laughlin WF minus one electron. Then, since there are $m$ electrons, we say that a hole has charge $+e/m$.\n\nNow, there are a lot of holes in this argument, most prominently us conveniently discarding the Pauli-exclusion principle. This could however be forgiven by pointing at the plasma analogy again (as we shall see in a bit) and say that they will act like a single particle if close together. Furthermore, the argument does not work perfectly, as while $m$ holes look like the absence of one electron, this does not mean that every hole has the same charge.\n\nTo get a more satisfactory and concrete answer we will have to calculate the fractional charge the hard way, using the Berry Connection. While we need to introduce some more *things*, this will also allow us to /finally/ calculate the statistics of the particle, and, as a bonus, it also helps us make sense of the [[id:c1fb832a-c00d-48d5-8397-1cdd1f7617df][Aharonov Bohm Effect]].\n\n*** Berry phase\n\n# #+transclude: t :hlevel 5\n# [[id:3dad96b9-a6bf-449f-981e-4e141f865dd5][Berry Connection]]\n\nThe Berry phase is the phase that a particle picks up when it is \"around\" in one of its eigenstates by varying the /parameters/ of the hamiltonian from and back to the eigenstate again. The parameters are usually not the first thing we consider when writing down the Hamiltonian, but could be thought of as, for instance, the specific settings used to prepare the system. Varying these settings slightly (such as the temperature or something) might still keep the system in the same eigenstate, loosely similar to how many statistical mechanical micro-states could give rise to the same macrostate.\n\nContinuing that analogy, if we do this slow enough, the [[id:75068634-a939-42ae-815f-8c31d02cf5f5][adiabatic theorem (quantum)]] guarantees that the system will stay in its eigenstate.[fn:1]\n\nIf we do this, after moving the Berry phase back the system will have incurred a phase, the [[id:5441a486-c826-424d-a30a-e08b9208642b][Berry phase]]\n\n*** Berry Connection\n* The explanation of anyons\n\n  #+include: \"./20210402123014-the_configuration_space_explanation_chapter.org\" :minlevel 4\n\n[[id:3cb8cc7b-70c4-4613-9f5e-3d73f9c6d476][The configuration space explanation chapter]]\n\n#+include: \"./20210414134239-if_particles_cannot_be_closer_than_the_thickness_of_the_strip_the_configuration_space_is_approximately_2d.org\" :minlevel 4\n[[id:654e4bfd-594e-48f2-b6b1-7ad252e1c05c][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n** TODO \n\n#+transclude: t\n[[id:837f70f5-94cf-4257-87cf-d9394ba2e8ba][Proof ballspace is not simply connected]]\n\n#+transclude: t :level 2\n[[id:7afb3d23-edad-45ad-97c1-58ac1ca6857d][How does QM work in non-simply connected space?]]\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[id:8f75ad04-3266-4fbc-8159-9a5b7532ccb4][How to justify particles not being able to escape]]\n\n* Footnotes\n\n[fn:3] The spin-statistics theorem is only provable in relativistic quantum mechanics.

Therefore, since small 3D is not approximately 2D, the 2D idealization is truly indispensible to our explanation of the emergence of anyons and we therefore ought to take it ontologically seriously.\n\nNow that we have finally grasped the core of Shech's argument, we are at last able to push back a little. At the end of this chapter, I will have shown how to fully make sense of the emergence of anyons in the quantum Hall system without relying on the 2D idealization. Before that however, I want to make it at least somewhat plausible that this /can/ be done.\n\nTo start, as we have seen above, to derive the existence of anyons, i.e. particles whose phase under exchange $\\neq 0,1$ , we do not necessarily require the configuration space to be $2D$, but merely for said configuration space to be non-[[id:2e0a3a59-3794-4b5f-8313-f630d88a7a87][Simply connected]]. Therefore, it seems plausible that an approximate 3D explanation could get off the ground, if only we can show that it is non-simply connected. The rest of the chapter serves as that argument.\n\n** First steps\n\nTo gain some confidence in the idea, let us  prove that an idealized /3D/  configuration space can also be non-simply connected. The key reason why the 3D configuration space constructed previously is necessarily simply connected is due to the fact that we 'merely' have a zero-dimensional hole at the origin where the two particles would intersect, which, since we also want to describe fermions, is forbidden by the Pauli-exclusion principle.[fn:1]  According to our current best scientific theories, fermions (and presumably the anyons under question as well) are understood best as point-particles, and thus the intersection being a single point in configuration space seems to be justified. I claim, however, that if this condition would be relaxed, allowing for a larger \"forbidden\" space, then,  in conjunction with two other plausible premises, we arrive at a multiply connected 3D configuration space. If this sounds rather ad-hoc, that is because it is. The final argument will not rely on these assumptions, so for now I believe they cause little harm. although I will attempt some minor justification at the end of this section.\n\nThe main idea is the following: if the minimum distance between the particles is greater then the \"height\" of the configuration space (here the size of the QH system), the 3d configuration space becomes multiply connected as well, as there are no paths which will \"loop over\" the singularity points. Imagine a box with a billiard ball in the middle which pokes out of the top and bottom, this is a reasonable model for now for the possible configurations of the particles.\n\nTo construct this configuration space we require three conditions on top of the ones already mentioned before ($(\\mathbf{r_1}, \\mathbf{r_2})=(\\mathbf{r_2, r_1})$ and $|r|\\neq 0$)\n1. $\\Psi(r_i\\geq b_i)=0$ where $b_i \\quad i=x,y,z$ are the dimensions of the quantum Hall system. This says: the probability of finding the particle outside the quantum Hall system is $0$, which is not exactly true but for now works as a useful assumption, modeling the boundaries of the system as an infinite potential well\n2. $\\Psi(|r|\\leq a)=0$, where $a$ is some real number representing the minimum allowed distance between the two particles\n3. $b_x, b_y\\geq a \\geq b_z$ (or really any of the dimensions, it just needs to be )\n\nBoth of these will be argued for in more detail below, but for now I claim that /if/ $\\exists a\\geq \\beta\\in \\mathbb{R} \\quad \\Psi(r\\leq a)=0$, where \\beta is the height of the fractional quantum Hall system and \\alpha the minimum distance allowed between the two particles, then the resulting configuration space will be non-simply connected.\n\nTo briefly sketch an intuitive picture, let us recall our $d$-dimensional configuration space @@latex: \\eqref{confspaceddim} @@ and the fact that we are only really interested in the latter half of that configuration space, as the absolute position of the particles (e.g. the location of the quantum Hall system) should not really matter. So we are just looking at the paths in\n\\[S=\\frac{\\mathbb{R} ^3-\\Delta }{Z_2} \\]\n\nNow we add our conditions above. 2) creates a sphere of forbidden particle positions around the origin (where the particles are near one another), which we can model as subtracting those a sphere of radius $\\alpha$, called  $\\sigma$, from the configuration space. Since \\sigma encompasses the points \\Delta, we can leave out \\Delta. Additionally,  1) means we are excising the points outside of the QH system, which I will represent with $\\beta$ , which are the points ranging from $[-\\frac{b_i}{2},+\\frac{b_i}{2}] \\quad i=x,y,z$ .[fn:2] Thus creating our new configuration space for $2$ particles\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tilde{Q}'= \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^{3} -\\sigma -\\beta  }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:goodconf}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhich can be crudely represented as\n[[./media/ballspace.png]]\n#+caption: Exaggerated representation of $\\tilde{Q}'$\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:ballspace\n\n*** \"Proof\"\n$\\tilde{Q}'$ is clearly non-simply connected, as there are loops that can be formed around the center of the space which cannot possibly be deformed into a point. This envisioning is similar to the [[id:c1fb832a-c00d-48d5-8397-1cdd1f7617df][Aharonov Bohm Effect]], in which the configuration space contains an infinitely high solenoid at the origin, preventing loops from closing.\n\n#+latex: {\\color{red}(I am unsure how to prove this rigourously, nor whether that would be necessary.

These don't follow from each other directly, but since the homotopy classes of both are identical I don't see much need to illustrate this in much detail})\n\nA rigorous derivation of the fundamental group of these spaces is highly non-trivial (see for instance cite:Fox1962 for the derivation of the 2D case). I will instead do the normal philospher of physics thing, namely to gesture at a proof which I belief will probably hold.\n\nThe only thing we need to show is that the $3D$ case is not different in any relevant  respect to the $2D$ one. In case of the fundamental group, the relevant respect is the number of [[id:896697ec-2e29-446e-9caf-7919b3639bdb][Homotopy equivalent paths]], the classes of paths which cannot be continuously deformed into one another. In a non-simply connected space, a path which winds around a \"hole\" cannot continuously be deformed into one which does not, nor can a path which winds around said hole twice be deformed into one that only winds around it once, or winds around it twice clockwise.\n\nLuckily for us, the  homotopy equivalent paths of  $\\tilde{Q}'$ are the same as those for $\\tilde{Q}$ , as all the paths that wind around the \"origin-hole\"  $k$ times can be continuously deformed into one another in both cases, and no other winding-sites exist. If our space would have additional holes, that could pose a problem, but for now we can rest easy.\n\nThus, since the number of homotopy classes is the same, the fundamental group is also identical, namely $B_N$ for $N$ particles. Therefore the $1D$ rep will remain the same, and the particles will not be limited to a phase of $0$  or $1$, and therefore anyons are possible.\n\n\n** Justifying the conditions\nWhile I will give some justification below, let us consider one line of argument: since (presumably) the configuration space just constructed allows for the existence of anyons, why do we not simply discard our previous idealization and insert this one into the EIA? Sure, it has some quirks, but the condition that particles cannot come within a certain distance of one another is hardly more problematic than assuming the particles cannot move in an entire dimension. The additional criterion of the wavefunction being zero outside the QH system similarly appears less restrictive than the 2D idealization.

This is not a new thought, but one I wish to explore in this thesis.\n\n** Specifically: words seem to denote a very precise ontological thing, but our epistemological capacities arent that precise\n\nI believe there exists a massive mismatch between the way we use language (names and/or concepts in particular) and how we conceptualize the ontology of the world. In short it is this: the _names_ we use for objects and _concepts_ in our language are discrete, while the space underlying them is continuous. That is, while we use names and concepts as if they have a definite _boundary_, there does not seem to be a clear line we can draw between the object and not-object, the concept and not-concept. Their boundary seems to be _vague_, indeterminate, fuzzy, etc.\n\n(this is not really a good example, I could start with \"human\" or \"the human that X\" or something. It's a much more familiar and vivid example, but it does veer into philosophy of biology more easily, so I'm weary to use it as a starting off point. Ideally I'd use a physics example but I don't have one that's quite so vidid as \"human\")\nNames and the objects they refer to are discrete in the way that one definite signifier is intented to represent one definite object or kind of object (natural kinds, I think): it is implied that the name refers to something with a definite spatio-temporal boundary. The problem of vagueness arises from the contrast between this proposed definiteness of boundary with the actual continuity of space, which does not lend itself to having distinct, point-like boundaries. In some cases this is more apparent than others. Take the name \"the football used in the 2016 world cup finals\" and the object it refers to, the actual football. The name implies, by use of \"the\", that there is one unique object, the actual football, it describes.\n\nAt first glance this appears uncontroversial: there is only one football which was used during the final, no exchanges were made and no \"multi-ball\" rule was suddenly introduced. The issue however is that we do not believe that footballs are fundamental constituents of reality, were there to be such things as fundamental consituents of reality. Instead we think that footballs are composed of smaller objects which may be fundamental consituents of reality, such as molecules, atoms, protons, quarks, and so forth. This fact leads to there not being a one to one mapping between the name \"the football used in the 2016 World Cup finals\" and a definite set of fundamental consituents of reality in a number of ways.\n\nThe first is a basic line drawing problem. This problem in fact already presents itself without thinking of the football as being composed of smaller consituents, as it is a consequence of the presumed continuity of space. It is not possible to pinpoint the exact location where the ball begins and ends, simply because it is not possible to measure a real number.\n\nThe second is due to specific physical theories: because of the uncertainty principle, there simply is no fact of the matter where the final electron belonging to the football and not to not-the-football is located in space, except of the De Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which is not per se popular.\n\nThe third and final issue with delineating the football is a more familiar matter: our idea of \"the football\" is not so fine-grained as to allow for the minute differences that happen to the football over the course of even a second. Kicking the football will result in some molecules separating from the main clump, perhaps adding some from the dirt, some of its atoms will decay, it will radiate away some heat and absorb some more: the exact state of the football changes across its life, second to second, moment to moment.\n\nThis third problem is best conceptualized using the Sorites paradox, which is not specific to names but to properties and concepts more generally as well. The basic idea can be summarized as follows: ten thousand grains of rice makes a heap of rice (or X collection of atoms make up \"the football\"). 9.999 grains of rice still make up a heap, as does 9,998. It appears that if N grains of rice make up a heap, then N-1 grains of rice also make up a heap. However, by mathematical induction, this would force us to conclude that any x grains of rice makes up a heap, including 1 grain of rice, which is patently false. To combat this, we can postulate that there exists a definite boundary between \"being a heap\" and \"not being a heap\". However, since the only way in which we can affect the heap is by adding or subtracting a grain of rice, this would lead to the other false conclusion that there exists an x such that X grains of rice do not make a heap while X+1 grains of rice do make a heap, which goes against the premises of the first argument: a true paradox.\n\n** I don't want to directly tackly meaning/vagueness/boundaries because it's hard. Instead I will look at physics because I know physics, and they sort of do this\n\nThese problems are deep and substantial, and while tackling them head on might be an option, I instead wish take a more roundabout route for exploring them by relating them to an area that explicitly deals with making precise denotations of an continuous mess: physics.\n\n** Physical Models/Idealization\n\nI take it as uncontroversial that physicists construct models, such as the Standard Model of Particle Physics, with a goal being to, at the very least, at some point make predictions about the outcomes of experiments. I furthermore take physics to be that what physicists do. Therefore one of the goals of physics is to construct models which make accurate predictions about the outcomes of experiments. This is a very conservative picture of physics.\n\n** Physics is a good case study as they use models which are analogous to the thing im interested in\n\nThe link between physics and the way words represent concepts becomes more clear when taking a slightly more ambitious stance towards the enterprise of physics, namely as constructing models which, in one or more aspects, _represent the world_. Representing an aspect of the world through a model is analogous to representing an object by a name, or more generally a concept by a word: continuous nature is fit into rigid molds. Investigating this link, therefore, might show us something about language more generally.\n\n** Too difficult on its own, let's just look at idealizations or abstractions\n\nHowever, attempting to evaluate how, if at all, physics represents \"reality\" directly proves no less difficult than attempting to determine that for words, concepts, objects, natural kinds etc. in general. Here, too, we need to narrow our scope to attack this question in any sensible way. I propose that the relevant aspect of physical modelling lies in its employment of idealizations and abstractions in order to simplify the mess that is continuous reality.\n\nAlthough the nature of idealizations and abstractions (henceforth I will just write idealization) will be spelled out in more detail later, it is worth noting some of its basic features and some similarities with the larger issue of denotation.\n\n\n(For the moment I will treat idealizations and abstractions as basically being the same thing, idealizations probably being more specific than abstractions. It is important and necessary to determine whether these do amount to the same thing however, see for instance cite:Shapiro2004, cite:mancosuAbstractionInfinity2016, cite:Lutz or cite:Knox2016 or cite:2016\nAlthough one clear difference does already spring to mind: idealizations are usually strictly false, while abstractions are more akin to generalizations, in that they are not false but simply cover more phenomena. Idealizations might not be a subtype of abstraction, but maybe a feature of it. I might start by introducing abstractions first, then focusing on idealizations later as a way to tackle that, but I am not sure of that step yet.)\n\n** Why should we pick idealizations\n\n   The solution is to pick specific aspects of a model that get close to the problem at hand. To this end I suggest using the idea of an \"idealization\", as idealizations are somewhat analogous to what I see as discreitziation, and are an import component of models. One of the key tasks will be to first flesh out the concept of an idealization, how necessary they are to models and how the relate to discretization. This will be done in chapter [[file:../../.local/share/Trash/files/20210106131334-chapter_idealizations_meta.org][Chapter Idealizations (meta)]]. I will specifically have a look at a subclass of idealizations: infinite or infinitesimal idealizations. This is because I believe they highlight what goes wrong with idealizations more clearly in a way that mirrors the general problem of discretization.\n\n** TODO Why Infinite idealizations\n*** Actual reason: (Shech makes this literal argument)\n*** What is an infinite idealization\n\nAn infinite idealization is an idealization in which some relevant property is set to 0 or infinity, rather than approximating it as being arbitrarily small or large.\n\n*** How does it differ from a normal idealization\n\nInfinite idealizations differ from \"normal\" or simple idealizations, to borrow cite:Strevens2019a 's terminology, in which a value is simply set to some other value.\n\n*** What's the goal of an infinite idealization\n\nFirst we must separate what an infinite idealization does from what it is meant to do.\n\n*** Infinite idealizations lead to problems\n**** Limit system does not exist\n**** Limit system disagrees with actual system\n** EIA\n*** Physical models and their idealizations are only a good case study if they are claimed to represent trutfully/literally\n\nThe relation between idealizations/abstractions and aspects of the world does not prove to be such a direct candidate for comparison between names and objects so easily, as there exists an important difference between the rough picture of physics sketched above and the question of how to match the discrete objects to continuous \"name space\": the models of physics do not per se truthfully represent the world, at least not until we stipulate such a thing. In contrast, when talking about the problem of discrete names not matching their continuous objects, the problem only arises when we imagine the word to truthfully represent the object, or, less strongly, to factor into true propositions about that object e.g. \"the football is round\". Similarly, models can only be used to study the boundary problem if we stipulate that the truthfully represent the world in some relevant aspect. (the relevant aspect quantifier is there because we do not expect our current models to grasp every relevant structure of the world, e.g. no emperically backed theory of quantum gravity exists as of yet.)\n\n*** Scientific realism claims that the idealizations truthfully represent\n\nFortunately, a rich philosophical tradition exists which espouses just the view that physical models truthfully represent, at least in some respect, the world: scientific realism. This tradition is no monolith however, and many competing and often incompatible interpretations exist, some more modest than others. More conservative, modern takes on the subject such as the structuralist realism espoused by James Ladyman and John Ross, are not easily said to believe that physical theories \"represent\" some relevant aspect of the world, rather they claim that such models \"latch on\" to relevant structures of the world, whatever they may be.\n\n*** The EIA as a case study/representative of scientific realism\n\nFor the purposes at hand, namely to elucidate how, if at all, the continuum can be discretized, it is more instructive to at least initially turn our gaze to stronger, more bold variations on scientific realism. The strongest seriously discussed version of scientific realism are based on Putnam-Quine style indispensability arguments, the \"naive\" version of which goes as follows:\n\n**** \"Naive\" Indispensability Argument\n\n    1. We ought to believe in the existence of those entities which are indispensable to our best scientific theories.\n    2. X is indispensable to our best scientific theories\n    C. We ought to believe in the existence of X\n\n   The \"naive\" is put in scare quotes here because this version of the indispensability argument has (more than) one shortcoming, in it leaving unclear what being indispensable to a scientific theory entails. What is it to be dispensable to a theory? To solve this, the modern form of the argument, the \"Enhanced Indispensability Argument\" (EIA), is used instead, which goes as follows:\n\n**** Enhanced Indispensability Argument (EIA)\n\n   P1. We ought to believe in the existence of those entities which are indispensable to our best scientific explanations\n   P2. X is indispensable to our best scientific explanations\n   C. We ought to believe in the existence of X\n\nThe focus has now shifted from indispensability for our best scientific theories to explanations in stead. This move is motivated by two thoughts. For one, it assumes that to succeed as a scientific theory is to offer a good explanation, or at the very least that providing a good explanation is good enough grounds to believe in its existence, provided that being indispensable to our best scientific theories is more than sufficient already. That is, offering good explanations is a necessary condition for being a good theory, as we do not think a theory succeeds without it. It is close to being a sufficient condition for constituting a good scientific theory as well, but I am hesitant to claim so on the grounds that what consitutes a \"good\" explanation is rather contentiuous, as we shall see, and that the number of phenomena a theory can explain does seem to matter as well. I do not believe that an extremely specific theory which somehow makes little to no reference to existing theories and is able to explain a single phenomenon well would count as a succesful one (although it might be argued that calling this an explanation would be questionable, but I digress).\n\nSecond, it carries with it the hope that \"being indispensable to explanation\" is easier to clarify than \"indispensability to a theory.\" This second thought requires one to buy that a) scientific explanation can be satisfactorily defined and delineated from not-\"scientific explanations\", which includes both non-explanations and non-scientific explanations (henceforth with \"explanation\" I will mean \"scientific explanation\" unless otherwise specified). Furthemore, it requires us to find plausible that b) finding that which is indispensable for those explanations is more straightforward than for theories as a whole. I will not grant these moves immediately and will scrutinize them in what's to come.\n\n*** What can the truth or falsity of the EIA possibly lead to\n\nBefore saying why looking at the Putnam-Quine argument could provide us insight on the much more general problem of discretization, let us first evaluate what sort of conclusions we could draw from our investigation. To start, let us say that thoroughly examining the Putnam-Quine argument leads us to consider it a valid form of inference to the actual consituents of the world, and furthermore we find entities or other things for which the argument holds. Our quest would then be complete, as we have found a way to justify dividing up the continuum of space and time (or \"thought space\" in the case of mathematical objects) into discrete, consituent parts (given that the entities which enter in the argument are discrete, which I will argue later they are). This provides a sufficient answer to the \"if at all\" part, and sheds some light on the \"how\" part, though does not exhaust the possibilities. For instance, it would provide little clarity on how, if at all, we do so in ordinary language when talking about footballs and tables, except if we take the EIA to be an exhaustive guide to all actual entities, something which the argument cannot entail in its form stated above.\n\n*** If we were to find that (infinite) idealizations do not factor into the EIA, why is it useful for the main problem of \"discretization\"\n\nAs the reader might have expected, I am not so optimistic about the EIA's chances of meeting the demands to be spelled out. How, then, would investigating it yield us any fruitful information about discretization? For if the EIA does not turn out to be a valid form of inference for determining the discrete parts of reality, it would not rule out the possibility of doing so, much less show us why it is impossible in the first place. In particular, the EIA provides a sufficient condition for something to have ontological status, not a necessary one. Therefore failing to be indispensable to explanation does preclude any entity/structure from having ontological status. (Is this true? Is the EIA not \"those and only those\"?)\nThis concern is real and valid. In fact, finding that the EIA is not valid would not rule out anything about the discretization on its own. Instead, the EIA provides a case study in which to more concretely tackle an instance of this problem, and my hope is that by examing its workings applied to specific examples to be expounded upon below, we might learn something valuable about the more general problem in the process. Given the scope and generality of the issue, it would be extremely optimistic to hope to solve it in a lifetime, much less one thesis, so my aims are more humble: to extract from the EIA some valuable lessons for tackling the discretization problem (or whatever you want to call it.)\n\n*** Why it's worth looking at idealization at the EIA (again)\n\nAs mentioned previously, we seem to have lost the \"how\" in the \"how, if at all\" formulation of the main question in the step of attempting to apply the EIA to idealizations. One argument in favor of this step is that it is a necessary condition for explaining \"how\" something works, /that/ it works at all first. Additionally, the hope is that by showing \"how not\" the EIA, we learn something about \"how not\" to answer the question of discreteness. While the possibilities for discretization are technically endless, humans only need a finite number of counterexamples in order to be dissuaded of the usefulness of something. This rather severe limitation might then be a better starting point: to provide reason for distrusting discretization of continua, rather than providing a direct counterargument. If a direct counterargument comes up, so much the better. If we end up concluding that (infinite) idealizations cannot factor into the EIA, at least we have something.\n\n*** Two ways of evaluating the EIA: P1 and P2\n\nIn order for the EIA to be a sound argument, its premises must entail its conclusion and its premises need to be true. The argumentative structure of the EIA is as straightforward as it gets, so it is valid. The premises, however, are controversial to say the least. Therefore the soundness of the EIA hinges on the acceptance of its premises, meaning that there are two ways the EIA could fail: either it is not true that we ought to believe in those entities that are indispensable to our best scientific explanations, or the relevant entity X is not indispensable for our best scientific theories. Let us say something about each of these in turn.\n\n**** What does arguing against premise 1 give us\n\nRegarding permise 1, arguing against the premise that we ought to believe in those entities that are indispensable for our best scientific theories is arguably the strongest move one could make, as it prevents the argument from taking off at all. Such a line of argument is common among anti-realists.\n\n**** Why not to tackle premise 1\n\nHowever, I would prefer not to take this line of argument for two reasons. For one, I feel it is not so convincing to the putative realist. Many convincing anti-realist arguments have already been made by van Fraassen etc, so I find it unlikely I would be able to sway a realist by making such an argument. Secondly, a succesful argument against premise 1. would take the form of one of the following:\na) argue against explanations, either playing a (crucial) role in forming our explanations or the possibility of explanations in general\nb) argue against indispensability as a criterion for belief in entities\nc) argue against believing in entities, whether some specific entities or entities in general.\n\na) and b) would not entail much at all about the discretization question, while an argument for c) could instead directly be used as an argument for the main problem or again not entail much, as \"we ought not to believe in the existence of entity X\" would simply remove X from the list of things to consider demarcatably, while \"we ought not to beleve in any entity X (which has certain general properties)\" could be reformed as \"we are not able to demarcate discrete objects with property X\", which defeats the point of using the EIA at all.\n\n**** We should look into premise 2 instead\n\n   Therefore, I wish to focus on premise 2: X is indispensable to our best scientific theories. One might immediately object that this is subject to the same charges as before, namely that looking at some class of objects X, say electrons, will likely not entail much about the conclusion in general. The way around this is to pick our X carefully. A candidate could be models in general, as finding out that models are not indispensable would make us not have to believe in them, and if models are analogous to concepts in the sense that they discretize a messy continuum, this might show us something about how this is done in general. However, this is too broad a task, as (almost) all physical explanation concerns models and what consitutes a model is (ironically) difficult to define. This is then subject to the same charge as that for denying explanation outright, or just impossible.\n\n*** Why not use this for premise 1 tho\n\nBut why can we not pick infinite idealizations for conclusion 1 instead, i.e. argue whether or not we ought to believe in the \"existence\" of infinite idealizations if they are necessary for our best scientific explanations, rather than evaluating whether they are in fact dispensable or not? Good question. I believe that arguing against the conditional, be that by denying the consequent or the antecedent, is getting ahead of ourselves. It makes the thing not so useful.\n\n*** TODO MORE TEXT JUSTIFYING WHY IM TACKLING THE EIA ON ITS SECOND PREMISE GOES HERE\n* On explanation\n\nBefore evaluating the indispensablity of certain entities/whatever to the purported explanation of physical phenomena, we need to come to an agreement how, if at all, these explanations explain.\n\nThe stance Shech takes to explanation is a sociological (?) one: explanations are what scientists call explanations. According to Shech, it is not the role of the philosopher to dictate what are good or bad explanations, to say what is good or bad science. \"If one's favorite account of explanation does not account for the standard story [of explaining the FQHE], so much the worse for one's favorite account of explanation\", he says determinately.\n\nI am have two conflicting thoughts on the subject.\n\nOn the one hand, I agree that judging a purported explanation only by reference to \"the\" correct account of explanation is unwise. The decades long debate on explanation has yielded little in the way of consensus about the correct account of explanation, even by the low bar of what is considered consesus in philosophy. Even the deductive nomological account, while seen by many as fatally flawed by not being able to account for the assymetric nature of explanation or being able to distinguish explanatory relevant factors from explanatorily irrelevant ones, is still the most commonl way of explicating explanation, usually prefaced with a half-hearted acknowledgment that is indeed flawed and that these half-hearted apologetics for using it anyway are a cliche in themselves. Other accounts, such as the unificationist account by Kitcher and that other guy, the plethora of causal mechanical models, the interventionist account, mechanistic ones etc, while not enjoying the widespread adoption of the DN model, are still being argued over, with nothing close to a definitive distancing from any of them being the case.\n\nTherefore, arguing the wrongness of an explanation based on it not fitting a certain model of explanation is not particularly convincing for two reasons. One, it requires one to first convince the reader that this account of explanation is the correct one (just trust me), which as seen above, does not seem particularly likely. Secondly, ??\n\nOn the other hand, however, I do not wish to simply do away with any sort of measure of explanatoriness (definitely a word) and to uncritically accept the explanations offered by scientists.\n\nCould lead us to accept bad explanations. Supersymmetry?\n\nHow do we know when the scientific community has accepted something?\n\nTreating the word of scientists as gospel like this does a disservice to them, as it sort of presumes scientists don't and moreover cant set critiria for what is a good explanation.\n\nThis division between philosophy and science seems kind of weird.\n\nWe might be able to identify some common criteria of those things we consider good explanations. For instance, we do not have strongly believe that super symmetry is a good exlpanation for (INSERT WHAT SUPER SYMMETRY EXPLAINS) anymore. Do we believe this simply because physicists have moved on or because there are good reasons for not believing its explanatory capabilities? The latter of course, empirical adequacy is a very important one, which is also a reason we don't consider most of the claims of string theory as explanatory correct.\n\n\nHowever, we must be weary of not simpy defining another concept of explanation. Instead, there are two ways of evaluating the question \"how, if at all, does theory/argument/... X explain phenomenon Y\"?\n\n1. Evaluate whether for every theory of explanation the theory explains. This is the most comprehensive way of tackling the question, and can lead to two answers, only the latter of which is really satisfying\n   a) theory X explains phenomenon Y on accounts of theory of explanation A, B, and C, but not on account of D, E, etc. Therefore, if one believes theories A, B, or C to be the correct theory of explanation, the X explains Y.\n      The problem with this is that either one ends up arguing for the validity of A B or C, which as discussed is dubious or simply leaves it up for the reader to decide for themselves if they believe A B or C, which lacks quite some argumentative force.\n   b) according to all common theories of explanation A, B, ... X does/does not explain Y. Therefore it is plausible to assume X does/does not explain Y, as every theory agrees on the subject.\n   Not only is this quite the amount of work, it is unlikely that we would reach such unanymous agreement, as some theories have widely varying criteria for explanation. Consider for isntance the differnce between causal mechanical and unifying explanations for instance: the former requires an account of how the phenomenon comes to be from the fundamental constituents of the thing and can decide per explanation whether it explains or not, while the latter only requires an explanation to group some set of phenomenon and is not able to say of an individual explanation whether it is \"good\" or not (as most explanations will probably unifity ~some~ phenomena), only whether one explanation is better than another. Comparing the question \"account X constitutes as a good explanation for Y\" (as we are interested in our \"best\" scientific explanations, whatever that may mean) for both the unficationist and the causal mechanical model will therefore prove quite challenging, as a good causal mechanical explanation is just a causal mechanical explanation, while the \"goodness\" of a unificationist explanation is much more graded.\n\n   These are just some of the challenges that come to mind, but again I deem it unlikely unanymous agreement unlikely in the first place, let alone satisfactorily determining whether every explanation is adequate. Does the thermodynamic limit prove a good explanation under all these accounts? Causal mechanical it is certainly doubtful, although some have argued otherwise, see Strevens.\n\n2. Determine some shared criteria all accounts of explanation (should) obey, and evaluate whether these explanations match these criteria.\n\n   This method has two pitfalls\n\n   a) If they obey all of the criteria, this does not mean that it is a successful explanation per se. The criteria only serve a negative purpose, barring would be explanations from attaining such status, as it provides only necessary conditions, no sufficient ones, by design.\n\n   b) Being arbitrarily normative, or rather begging the question\n      If one were to define exclusion criteria for what ought to count as explanation, we need to watch out that we do not beg the question. We must take great care to justify these exclusion criteria, otherwise it can come across as us simply taking elements from these explanations and labeling them as bad. Furthermore the risk exists of excluding an entire category of explanatory theories, which defeats the point.\n\n      (This might happen for instance when one assumes that a good explanation ought to determine which objects in said explanation \"make a difference\", see e.g. cite:DeBianchi2016 )\n\n**** TODO Figure out whether the difference maker discussion excludes the DN model or unificationist model\n*** Goal of the explanation strategy\n\nIn short, the goal in this section is to identify exclusion criteria for explanations that do not\n  a) have arbitrary justification\n  b) exclude an entire theory of explanation\n  c) postulate a new theory of explanation, i.e. be a sufficient condition for explaining.\n     I am not exactly sure what this would look like, but I have one criterion that looks like this\n\n*** Another objection\n\nHow /can/ you identify such criteria? What source of \"explanation\" are you drawing from? The platonic ideal of explanation?\n\nThis is a valid point, but one I can't really answer right now, maybe I'll have a smart reply later.\n\n*** The criteria\n**** TODO A lot. This will form the very foundation of my thesis, while being the most specific part. In order to give a better account here I need to look into the specific phenomena more deeply. What would I gain from that? I feel like I can formulate that to make sense somehow. Self-consistency? Is that different than non-contradiction? It's more of a given,\n**** 1. To warm up, let us begin by defining the most basic criteria any explanation ought to satisfy: it needs to account for the actual empirical thing, save the phenomena as we are fond of saying.\n\n   - Is this part of explanation or of a theory?\n\n**** 2. It needs to follow some sort of \"because\" clause.\n\n   - Very general\n\n**** 3. ...\n**** 4. ...\n**** 5. It needs to create /understanding/ in some agent.\n\n   This might the most crucial one and the most difficult to define. It does hinge on the question: do explanations exist independently of agents to understand them?\n   While this is a difficult question to answer, we need not do so here, provided that it satisfies our earlier defined points, namely is it arbitrary, does it exclude an entire theory of explanation or does it postulate a new one. Let's treat them in turn\n\n***** Arbitrariness\n\n        I'd say no. While not unobjectionable, it certainly does not seem arbitrary or begging the question, as for instance a criterion such as \"no infinities allowed\" would be. Discussion s about udnerstanding and its importance for explanation have been held for a long time in otrher gidelds and have more recently come up in philsophy of science.\n        Moreover it is at least pragmatically true that we would not be aware of any explanations that did not probive any\n\n***** Exclude an entire theory of explanation\n\n        While few of the majors actively include understanding, I argue that none would be significantly changed by including the requirement that they provide understanding.\n\n***** Too sufficient\n\n        This is arguably the biggest charge one could levy against this criterion, since \"providing understanding\" in the sense that someone understands a phenomena after hearing something which does that, sounds like it is explained to them. In order for it not to be sufficient, there need to be things missing from any (set of) proposition(s) which provide understanding, which need to be fulfilled in order to be considered an explanation.\n\n        One thing that comes to mind is that the agent /thinks/ it gained understanding, but in actuality the \"explantion\" which did so is false. Conspiracy theories would constitute such a case: our agent might believe that they gained understanding of the increasing number of autism diagnoses by being \"explained\" that if you get vaccinated then you get autism (or become more likely to get autism) and that the number of vaccinations given has increased. However, the first premise here is false. Has the agent then gained understanding of the increased rate of autism diagnoses? Or more importantly, does the \"explanation\" count as an explanation?\n\n        This would not count as an explanation on all counts of explanation.\n        1. DN: requires all premises to be true. Premise 1 is not true. Therefore not an explanation.\n        2. Causal mechanical: there does not appear that a true causal story of vaccines to autism can be told, therefore not true.\n        3. Interventionist: difficult to tell. While for a single individual it might be possible to intervene here, take an individual without autism and give them a vaccine, see if they develop autism. However few would claim that every single vaccine would cause autism, as most of the world would then be on the spectrum. It seems a lot more difficult to intervene in the course of history and not vaccinate everyone and to then compare whether the autism diagnosis rate remains the same. Counterfactual speculation seems difficult here, therefore it does not appear to be a good explanation.\n        4. Unificationist: as mentioned before, for unificationist accounts, \"good\" is relative. However, since we are interested in what our best scientific explanations are, we can compare this explanation of the increasing vaccine rate with a different one and evaluate which one has the greater unifying power. there's probably one right\n\n    So it might not count as an explanation, mostly on the fact that it is not true or better explanations exist. However, does it count as creating understanding?\n\n****** TODO Evaluate whether this counts as understanding\n\n            - Find definition/theories of understanding\n            - Apply them\n\n**** 6. \"It must match reality in some way\"\n\nThis is definitely begging the question man, we are trying to find this very thing remember? The hell does matching reality mean.\n\n**** 7. The explanation must not create a contradiction\n\nDuh. This seems like to banal to even mention, not sure if I can draw some interesting conclusions out of this.\n\nWhat I'm thinking about is the thermodynamic limit implying the existence of infinity particles, or FQHE implying 2D particles. However, I cannot take this as refuting the fact that they are explanations, as this is exactly the point of contention. Furthermore it's not a flat out paradox, as it is at least logically possible that some particles could be 2D, it is just very plausible /prima facie/.\n\n(Ideally after this section I'd have some kind of idea/criteria for what to look for in a good explanation. My worry is that doing this /before/ looking at the actual examples I either miss things or end up defining criteria based on my discussion of the examples later, which messes up the structure. Therefore I am uncertain of the place of a chapter on explanations in the structure)\n\n* Part II: The phenomena\n** Limit explanation of phase transitions\n\nIn thermodynamics, phase transitions (such as water boiling, a magnet losing its magnetization) are represented by a non-analyticity in the relevant thermodynamic function (such as pressure or magnetization).  The issue is that we do not consider thermodynamics to be the final theory of the world, and in particular do not find it sufficiently explanatory. Moreover, we have a theory we consider to be more \"fundamental\" than thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and would like to account for the phenomenon of phase transitions in said theory.\n\nHowever, the issue arises that the only way in which to directly recapture the thermodynamic phase transitions using statistical mechanical tools is by taking the so called \"thermodynamic limit\", in which the number of particles is taken to infinity while the volume of said particles goes to zero, keeping the density constant. This is because the thermodynaic variables needed for describing the phase transition in statistical mechanics are derived from the partition function, which is a sum of analytic functions. In order for the thermodynamic variables to exhibit a phase transition i.e. a non-analyticity, the partition must contain a singularity. The partition function can only do so if either the energy of the particles is 0, which is impossible, or if the sum is infinite. This latter result is not trivial, nor is it straightforwardly a theorem, but it is commonly accepted as such, see Kadanov.\n\nTherefore, in order to account for (to explain?) the phenomenon of phase transitions, it is claimed, the thermodynamic limit must be taken i.e. we need to make an infinite idealization. Moreover, it cannot easily be explained away by interpreting this \"limiting operation\" as an approximation, i.e. as one of simply seeing the the collection of atoms to be arbitrarily large. One cannot approximate a singularity: it is either there or not there. Therefore, only at N=infinity does the singularity present itself, not at any point beforehand.\n\nHowever, some, like Norton, argue that the singularity is approximated in some sense that is useful, as the curve of the graph gets closer and closer to the one at N=infinity as N->infinity. The important point then is which property we consider.\n\n** Aharanov Bohm effect\n\nSomething about a solenoid in a magnetic field, which needs to be infinite in order for the calculation to make sense. Something something Berry shift.\n\n** FQHE\n\nThe classical hall effect is the phenomenon of measuring a transversal voltage when running a current through the long side of a metal plate, because of Lorentz afguiging. More electrons on the right then on the left, thus potential difference thus voltage.\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect has two sub parts: the integer and fractional quantum hall effect. Let us start with the former. The integer quantum hall effect is observed when running a similar experimental setup to the classical hall effect, but with a much thinner and purer sheet. This gives weird plateaus at integer multiples of the quantum of resitance?. The explanation for these plateaus is some weird stuff about Landau levels, but is ultimately not too surprising.\n\nThe Fractional Quantum hall effect is the weirder one. As the name suggests it is similar in appearance to the integer quantum hall effect, the difference being that the plateaus occur at fractional (1/3 etc) values of the quantum of resistance, rather than at the integer levels. This is rather suprising however, as the explanation for the integer hall effect does not allow there to be fractional quanta. Another explanation, then, is needed. The effect only occurs at even thinner and purer sheets as well. One of the two effects requires a not too pure sheet, cannnot rememver which\n\n\nThe relevant point here is that in order for the explanation of the fractional quantum hall effect (and possibly the integer one as well?) to get of the ground, we /need/ to assume that the configuration space of the electrons in the sheet is two dimensional. For the explanation depends on the fact that the fundamental symmetry group of the particles is Bn, not Sn. Bn is the fundamental group of 2D space, and small 3D space does not equal 2D space. This is an important difference and makes this example much clearer than the Thermodynamic Limit, as this is cool.\n\n** Breaking drops\n\nIn his 2005 paper Breaking Drops something something  cite:Batterman2005 argues that the breaking off of a droplet from a dripping faucet is an example of a genuine discontinuity in nature. While not mentioning the word \"infinite idealization\", it is clear that it was he is implying when making the argument.\n\nThe argument is flawed by using weird conceptions of continuity, in particular by taking the infinite limit before the end of the operation.\n\n* Part III: Discussion(s)\n\n(In this part I want to evaluate what I got out of my discussion of the case studies and generalize from there. These needn't be whole chapters, but it's useful for me to think of them as such for now. I also do not have much of anything I could add here, as I simply do not know exactly what I will conclude yet.)\n\n* Bibliography\n** Boundaries, vagueness, \"denotation\"\n\n- cite:Varzi2015\n- cite:Varzi2001\n- cite:Sorensen1997\n- cite:WEBER2010\n- cite:Bueno2012\n- cite:Weatherson2016\n- cite:ungerProblemMany1980\n- cite:Sanford1975\n- cite:franklinArgumentsWhoseStrength2013c\n- cite:Hacking1991\n\n** (Infinite) Idealizations (theoretical, not applied to a particular problem)\n\n- cite:Strevens2019\n- cite:Strevens2007\n- cite:Strevens2008\n- cite:nortonInfiniteIdealizations2014\n- cite:Norton2012\n- cite:shechInfiniteIdealizationsPhysics2018a\n- cite:Fletcher2019\n- cite:Lutz\n- cite:Knox2016\n- cite:2016\n- cite:Shapiro2004\n- cite:Suarez2016\n- cite:Shech2015b\n- cite:Shech2013\n- cite:Batterman2009\n- cite:Batterman2001\n- cite:Butterfield2011\n\n** EIA\n\n- cite:Shech2019a\n- cite:Colyvan2006\n- cite:Colyvan1998\n- cite:Colyvan2019\n- cite:Panza2016\n- cite:Castro2013\n- cite:Baron2016a\n\n** Explanation\n\n- cite:Woodward2019b\n- cite:Wayne2011\n- cite:salmonFourDecadesScientific2006a\n- cite:Coffa1967\n- cite:Bangu2015\n\n\n  Overlaps much with the literature I gathered on idealization.

I propose 3 categories\n** Relevant domain\nThesis, on_thinking, self-improvement, communication, whatever. Don't be too specific with this but don't try to generalize it so your life only fits in four categories.\nThe goal is NOT to cleanly divide up everything, and its fine if something doesnt fit, and its fine if you later start to use different tags\n** More specific domain\nIdealizations, deep work, vagueness, whatever. You can also just do two of these tags, that might actually be better, with one maybe being less specific. Point being: there are two content specific tags, at least one kind of specific, a useful rule of thumb being that it has a word which is included in the body text.\n** \"vibe\"\nBy this I mean the character of the note. Good example is \"question\": some of my notes are question which I might not get into. Other notes are more definitions which I feel like are worth remembering. Others are prescriptive guidelines like this one. Others are more rants or trains of thought (which I should avoid). Others are summaries of a concept.\nThese are useful I think, because it allows me to kind of think what I want this note to do. Just categorizing \"thoughts\" as the Zettelkasten people like to say, like in [[id:b1667b51-b5c4-4b99-934e-9f071c76b507][The value of collecting thoughts over information]], is somewhat helpful, but I a) find it hard to distinguish the two, and \"thought\" is a really vague category, which to me isn't separate, like, things I want to remember per se.\n\nMaybe I will change my mind about this once I read cite:Ahrens2017 , but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

For instance, discussions surrounding essentialism have been around since Plato and are very closely connected to the topic at hand. Even though my thesis will not per se be an argument against essentialism, I should look at how this topic is tackled in order to\n   a) regain my enthousiasm for my thesis. My passion against essentialism transcends my distaste of Platonism and is what I actually want to tackle. Just talking about Platonism is too abstract, I need easier examples\n   b) find additional routes to tackle this topic. If this has either been done before very satisfactorily or in a way similar to my goals, it makes no sense at all try and construct myself out of this hole. Good philosophers think of things themselves, great philosophers let others do the thinking for them.\n c) know what not to do and which side-tracks to avoid. Although I do not think I will encounter the former that much, as I do not believe there is a strong pro essentialism argument, I do think that it is very easy to get lost in theories of naming etc., which I know will just end with me not doing anything useful.\n\n\n* Body\n\nFirst just start with putting some papers here with descriptions, tags, and related papers.

Furthermore, this conception is quite new, the older one is a lot more modest, namely only including those things that are\n            a) defined by a set of necessary and sufficient properties (at least on an IDEALIZATION) such that\n            b) the possession f trhese properties is indicative of a very large number of other methodologically interesting properties and such that\n            c) these defining properties are natural rather than socila properties\n\n            This paper might be useful depending on how strongly I can link natural kinds to my \"discrete categories\". Maybe they are the same. In any case, this paper is quite general, which is nice.\n\n**** Strongly related papers\n\n***** Richard Boyd, 1991: \"Realism, Anti-Foundationalism and the enthusiasm for natural kinds.\" cite:Boyd1991\n****** Tags\n******* natural kinds\n******* pro-essentialism\n******* general\n******* explanation\n****** Summary/Why it's useful\n                Argue against Hacking that many property-cluster kinds and social-kinds \"similarly\" to natural kinds (on the model, whatever that means). He argues that these kinds, when important for EXPLANATION or induction, have certain properties which are also necessary properties of natural kinds, and should therefore be treated similarly. These properties are\n                1. These kinds are defined a posteriori rather than socially \"invented\". There is phenomenon happening which we later give a name to, like gender. Gender in the abstract was introduced way later than gender norms.\n                2. The way we use these kinds in explanation or inductions requres that it be defined \"by a cluster of properties whose membership is determined by the CAUSAL STRUCTURE of the world\" and is therefore independent of our social conventions in that sense.\n                3. The way the relationship between the kind and the term that refers to it is established does not depend on our conventions but on the \"existence of an epistemically relevant pattern of causal relations between instantiations of the kind and the term in question\"\n\n                Sooo Boyd does argue in favor a broader definition of natural kinds, and possibly for there existence? He takes causation to be quite important which is always a risky move to make, but might work out for him.\n\n                His appeal to the explanatory power of the candidate natural kinds is very similar (probably even the same) kind of appeal Platonists make to the indispensability argument.

However, many things are postulated in physics and never realized, so just being an idealization does not make it intersitng.\n   However, anyons are claimed to be observed [@Bartolomei2020]. How then do we square this?\n\n\nSome, like [@Shech2019], go even further and claim that these kinds of observations give indirect evidence for Platonism, making anyons even more intersting to look at.\n\nThe standard explanation of anyons is inherently /topological/. Topological explanation share something inherently in common with idealizations, and are thus extra worth looking at.\n\nWe can't directly talk about the failure of any particular idealization, only about a certain property. Anyons are interesting because the property is existence.\n\n\nHowever, to properly understand anyons, we need to look at the actual systems from which they come, which are things that look like the quantum hall effect. Otherwise we are simply examining the idealization on its own, rather than seeing whether the idealization corresponds to reality in any way (super-symmetry etc). Therefore, we should look at the FQHE to properly evaluate the status of anyons.\n\nFrom examining this, we see that the phase does not arise topologically in the description of the quantum hall effect (as you cannot really calculate things with that) but /geometrically/. Thus we will need to examine how geometric phase works and whether and how this could be related to the topology.\n\nThis discussion will then offer some inspiration for how such topological questions should be thought of.\n- Topological explanations are not uncommon in physics, example?.\n\n** New intro\n\n=Good line to introduce the chapter=\n\n\nThe main subject of discussion here will be a new class of (quasi-)particles: anyons. In undergraduate courses, or, if you're lucky, highschool, we learn that two types of particles exist: fermions and bosons. These particles are distinguished by spin, half-integer and integer spin respectively. Anyons, as their name suggests, break this binary and are allowed /any/ type of spin, creating a whole new category of particle.[fn:4] While anyons are fascinating in their own right, we are interested in them because, according to the canon explanation, anyons are two-dimensional particles. More suggestively, the space they occupy cannot be /approximately/ $2D$, such as a $3D$ space of $1nm$ height, but /exactly/ two dimensional: a clear case of an infinite(simal) idealization. Of course, anyons would be just another plaything, were it not that, at the time of writing, anyons have rather strong empirical backing [@Bartolomei2020].\n\n\nAnother reason why anyons present such an interesting case, is that their explanation explicitly requires /topological/ arguments. Topological arguments, as I will show, show up in unexpected places and allow problematic idealizations to sneak in, as they smooth out many of the difficult to solve geometry. By tackling such an explicit use of topology in an infinite idealization, we will be able to use the argumentative structure in our general analysis of infinite idealizations. =The opposite of topology is geometry=\n\n*************** TODO this is a new task tallyho\n*************** END\n\n\n[fn:4] Or an infinite number of new particle types, depending on one's preference.\n\n\n\n* Topology and Anyons\n\nIn a standard physics undergraduate program, you learn that there are two types of particles, fermions and bosons, which are distinguished by their spin, fermions coming in half-integer multiples $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2} , ... )$ and bosons in integer multiples $(0, 1, 2, ...)$. A good starting question for understanding anyons would be: why /do/ we think there are only two types of particles? Why not $1$, or $3$, or infintely many? While many similar questions are as of yet unanswerable, such as why there appear to be only three generations of leptons (e.g. electrons, muons, tauons) or three fundamental forces in the standard model (electromagnetic, weak, and strong), this one does have an accepted answer. It is, as always, a combination of experimental results and theory. Fermions and bosons' share few features besides the fact that they are particles, but the important commonality is that they are both /indistinguishable/ particles. Every electron is the exact same as every other electron, and every photon is perfectly identical to the next. There is no way to tell whether two fermions or two bosons have switched places when you weren't looking. We will explore the consequences of this in more detail later, but the important consequence of this fact is that it induces an overdescription of the physical situation: we can mathematically describe two situations, one in which we have electron $1$ on the left and electron $2$ on the left. While mathematically distinct, these situations are physically identical, and in order for our physics to make sense we need to account for this distinction. The reasons for assuming indistinguishability could be a thesis topic in its own right, and the above description does not attempt to do it justice. The important point is /how/ we arrive from this indistinguishability to the fact that there are two types of particles: how does indistinguishability help us distinguish particles, and how do we mathematically distinguish these identical states?\n\nAs a warm-up, let us consider a rather handwavey argument. Handwavey, because it relies on the particles still being distinguishable, but it illustrates the point. Say we start with a system $\\Psi_0$ of two particles, $x_1$ and $x_2$, each with their own probability distribution $\\psi_i$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_a(x_1)\\psi_b(x_2)\\]\nNow, for our next trick, we will exchange the two particles, such that particle $x_1$ is in state $\\psi_a$ and particle $x_2$ is in state $\\psi_b$. If we suggestively take state $\\psi_i$ to be mean something like \"having probability $1$ of being found around $x=a$\", then this exchange can be the physical exchange of the two particles. Now, of course, we do not know which particle is which, so writing down the 1-exchange wave function would be getting ahead of ourselves, but we do know that if we were to exchange the particles once again we should regain our initial wavefunction $\\Psi_0$. To dentote this, we define an exchange operator $P$ which does just, and say that the wavefunction after exchanging twice (= rotating by 360 degrees) is $\\psi_{2\\pi}=P^2\\psi_0=1\\psi_0$. To find the wavefunction of the 1-exchang system, we find\n\\[\\psi_{\\pi}=P\\psi_0=\\sqrt{1}\\psi_0=\\pm 1\\psi_0\\]\n\nThis yields two possibilities for particles: those for with $P=-1$ and those for which $P=1$. The latter are bosons and the former are fermions.[fn:7]\n\n\n\n\nThe above argument is too handwavey, so we would like to make it more concrete. The way to define what we mean by \"exchange/ability/\". To start, the suggestively italicized /ability/ part of exchangeability hints at the fact that the /possible/ ways a particle /is able to be/ exchanged is of central importance. One natural way of defining this is by looking at all the possible paths the particle can take. We would need to look at the /configuration space/ of the particles: the possible configurations of them and connections between these configurations.[fn:8] Now we need to supplant this with a notion of what it means for two paths to be /the same/, or, equivalently, what it means for two paths to be different. This idea of path-similarity depends on which factors we judge relevant when considering manipulating quantum particles, which we need to choose if we wish to obtain the most general description possible. Like most of physics, we would not want our description to depend on some sort of absolute position or orientation in space, so our description better ignore those. Beyond that, however, identifying the relevant factors of the space becomes more tricky. The two most promising candidates are a /geometric/ or /topological/ notion of path similarity. As it turns out, the latter is used in the most commonly accepted explanation of anyons, the main reason being the mathematical and conceptual simplicity it brings.\n\nThe main notion of similarity used to explain anyons, namely the topological notion of /homotopy equivalence/, roughly means that two paths are the same if they can be continuously deformed into one another. This differs wildly from /geometric/ path equivalence: there paths are only \"the same\" if they traverse the same path in the same space, they need to be =isomorphic=. Consider the difference between a mountain ridge versus a nice meadow. Geometrically, the two are very different, and if we were to care about how exhausting a hike over that distance would be we would certainly not neglect to take those differences into consideration. On the other hand, if we were an amateur nautical cartographer interested in plotting out all bodies of water in the area, we would consider both spaces identically topologically: neither of them has any lakes. It is clear why a topological approach to particle paths would be attractive, as it massively simplifies the set of possibilities down to the bare essentials. It is clear that sometimes we do need to consider the relevant geometry however: our hiker will no doubt complain if their map-making friend confuses meadows for mountains, or vice versa depending on their constitution.\n\nReturning to anyons, we see that the approach taken for the /explanation/ turns out to be topological, while when actually calculating the phase we need to take into account the /geometry/. Here we will first discuss the topological argument, after which we will consider the prequisites for and the geometrical argument itself in Section 3 and 4.\n\nBy focussing on the homotopy notion of equivalent paths, we release ourselves from the burden of having to examine each individual path and instead are able to focus on features of the /space/. Specifically, since we only need whether two paths are continuously deformed into one another, we just need to look at whether the space allows for such trickyness. This feature of a space is called its *connectedness*. A space is called *simply connected* iff all /loops/ can be deformed into a point, like in figure ref:fig:connectedness. For our purposes, since we are looking at the position of a particle in spacetime, we can consider a space to be simply connected if it has no holes. Here a hole is a hole that \"pierces\" the space: the handle in the \"space\" of a coffeecup and the hole in the \"space\" of a donut are prime examples, while the inside of a bottle or a bubble in a glass of coke do not count as \"holes\" for the sake of connectedness. On the contrary, spaces with such holes are called /multiply-connected/, or sometimes more simply /non-simply-connected/ spaces.\n\nThis concept of connectedness allows us to understand the main assumption behind the handwavey argument above: we return to the same position after rotating 2\\pi if the space is simply connected, because \"being the same\" means \"being the same path\" and \"being the same path\" means \"being able to continuously deform them to each other\" and \"doing nothing\" is the \"point path\" and you are only able to shrink all paths to a point in a simply connected space. This, of course, raises the question: is the configuration space of two identical particles always simply connected, i.e., why do should we return to the same system after rotating $2\\pi$? As we will see, it is simply connected in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, but /not/ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is why people say that anyons can only exist in 2D. As we will also see, however, is that this is not strictly true, as we can conceive of somewhat plausible multiply-connected 3D spaces.\n\n[fn:7] Note that this does not directly follow: it could also be the case that particles just sometimes have -1 and other times +1. Empirically, however, we find no such distinction, only dependent on particle type.\n\n[fn:8] The other framework for considering such exchange is in terms of exchanging all the relevant quantum numbers, effectively mathematically swapping the particles. We shall see that this does not work for defining anyons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** Phase\n\nMuch of the upcoming section will be centered around calculating the /phase/ of a quantum system, and it will be useful to briefly go over what we mean by phase and its relation to anyons. Briefly stated, the phase factor is a complex number which does not change the physical information if applied globally, that is when multiplying every wavefunction under consideration with it. The $\\pm1$ applied by our operator $P$ is such a phase.\nPhase arises because the empirical outcome of measuring a quantum state involves calculating the modulo-squared of the wavefunction. There are simply (at least) two wavefunctions which arrive at the same outcome if you square them with their complex conjugate: - that wavefunction and plus that wavefunction. They are both perfectly fine mathematical representations of the same state, just like the fact that the square root of 9 can be both -3 and 3. When asked: what is the length of the side of a square field of 9 square meters, the answer is indeterminate: it can be either 3 or -3. Rather than saying it can only be positive, we can be a bit more general and say that the \"phase factor\" in front of the three is unphysical: it simply does not matter for calculating the surface area of the field what  it is. We have, of course, some empirical preference for using positive lengths in stead of negative ones, but we do not such physical intuitions for wave functions, as they live in Hilbert Space and we unfortunately only have 4D spacetime to our disposal. Since wavefunctions live in /complex/ Hilbert space, the most general factor that would get $||^2$ away is not $\\pm 1$, but $e^{i\\theta}$, as that simply /is/ the square root of $1$ in $\\mathbb{C}$. Thus any wavefunction will show empirical differences when multiplied with $e^{i\\theta}\\quad\\forall\\theta\\in \\mathbb{R}$\n\nIt is of course not immediately clear what this has to do with paths in configuration space or anyons for that fact. The answer is that, while systems could theoretically obtain any phase, they do not in general do so. We know from examining the time-dependent Schrodinger equation that it can be reduced to the time-/independent/ schrodinger equation times a phase factor, which depends on time and the energy of the system. However, while we said that phase does not matter physically, this is only the case for the system as a whole: if two systems have different phase they interfere. It's analogous measuring any other kind of wave: you will have to pick a starting point in order to describe the offset of a particular wave. These phases don't matter until you measure two waves interfering, which leads to inteference. For particles this leads to destructive interference for fermions: if the exact same wave would =xxxxxxxxxx= then there is probability zero of it being there. This is the Pauli-exclusion principle.\n\nThus while phases do not appear to matter /prima faciae/, they are the reason matter is able to exist in the first place! Without the Pauli Exclusion Principle it would not be possible for matter to clump together, as everything would simply phase through each other (barring electromagnetic interactions).\n\n\n#+transclude: [[id:3cb8cc7b-70c4-4613-9f5e-3d73f9c6d476][The configuration space explanation chapter]] :level 2\n\n\n** The configuration space explanation for anyons\n\nThe topological explanation gestured at above consists of roughly the following steps:\n1. Construct the /configuration space/ of the system, that is, all possible positions our particle pair could be in.\n2. Find all possible homotopy equivalent paths, and, by extension, the /fundamental group/ of the space.\n3. Derive the 1D-representation of that group, that is, a scalar representing that group. This is the phase-factor.\n\nWe will go through these steps in detail for the case of anyons and other particles. After showing that anyons appear to only be possible in 2D, we construct a toy 3D-configuration space in which anyons are also possible.\n\n\n*** The 3D case\n**** Constructing the configuration space\nOur first task is to construct the configuration space for the exchange of $N$ identical particles in $3D$, after which we will examine its topological properties. The most general configuration space we can construct is one for $N$ particles living in $d$ dimensions, which would be\n \n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbb{R}^d_1 \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_2 ... \\times \\mathbb{R}^d_N\n    \\label{eq:Ndconfig}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (1)$$\n\nWe shall for now focus on just two particles in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, which would be the configuration space occupied by two $3$-dimensional vectors $(r_1, r_2)$ representing two particles\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3  \\]\nAs we are dealing with identical particles, however, we need to add some extra structure, which results in our configuration space being much smaller than the above.\n\nTo simplify our notation and avoid having to conceptualize $9$-dimensional space, we can define our configuration space in terms of the center of mass of the particles $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1+r_2})}{2}$ and their difference vector $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r_1-r_2}$. Clearly the configuration space of $(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{r})$ is still $\\mathbb{R}^3\\times \\mathbb{R}^3$. However, now we can pull a trick. We only care about exchanging the particles, right? It seems reasonable, therefore, that the position of the system as a whole does not play in a role in determining all possible positions of the particle, e.g. it should not matter (we assume, quite reasonably) whether we exchange two fermions in our lab on Earth or on Venus. For our purposes, then, we can safely ignore one of the two $\\mathbb{R}^3$s and simply focus on the relative distance and orientation of the two particles with each other.[fn:9] This simplifies the problem of finding the configuration space significantly.\n\nLet us return to the constraints. The first constraint is the indistinguishability of the particles. Since it is impossible to distinguish the situation $(r_1,r_2)$ from $(r_2,r_1)$, we cannot take these two configurations to be separate points in configuration space and must remove them. We can represent this by \"dividing out\" the permutation group $S_2$ from our current configuration space,[fn:10] yielding\n\\[\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^3 }{S_2}\\]\n\nThe second and final constraint is accounting for particles not being able to intersect with each other. The argument for /why/ we ought to, however, is rarely made precise. The general tendency, as by\n\n#+transclude: [[id:654e4bfd-594e-48f2-b6b1-7ad252e1c05c][If particles cannot be closer than the thickness of the strip, the configuration space is approximately 2D]]\n\n[fn:9] Another way of thinking about this is to consider one particle to be fixed and the other moving around it.\n\n[fn:10] This makes it somewhat difficult to visually relate the \"one particle standing still\" picture to what the configuration space actually represents. Roughly, you can imagine it as the \"moving\" particle returning back to its original position after a rotation of $\\pi$ radians.\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect\n\nSo, anyons are claimed to be observed in 2D only.\nHowever, some claim that anyons are observed [@Bartolomei2020]  in actual systems. Does this mean that those systems are /actually/ two dimensional? This would go against much of our general intuition about systems.\n- Physisists claim that these systems are /approximatley/ or /effectively/ 2D (=sources=).\n- Following [@Norton2012], we know how to interpret this: we can demote an idealization to an approximation if we are able to show that there is a smooth limit.\n- This is exactly the problem, according to [@Shech2019]: the topological explanation of anyons requires an /exact/ 2D system (or a rather ad-hoc 2D system as we saw).\n- Therefore we cannot call this approximately 2D.\n- According to [@Shech2019], this is a problem for those with nominalist inclinations[fn:1], as the instantiation of abstract mathematical structures in the real world would be an issue.\n  - Such an argument can only be made, however, through the use of the EIA which was discussed in the previous (or next?) chapter.\n- Therefore, it would do such people well to examine the physical effect thoroughly for any signs of this.\n\n\n\nLuckily, hope is on the horizon: it turns out that the computations of the phase of the alledged anyons in the FQHE uses a geometrical notion rather than a topological notion of phase.\n- Unluckily, this geometrical notion also relies on a two dimensional idealization.\n- However, this idealization /could/ conceivably be demoted to an approximation.\n\nIn this chapter, we will examine the inner working of the Quantum Hall Effect. This is needed in order to understand the following\n1. Why do people say that these particles are anyons\n2. What idealizations are made in the explanation of the quantum hall effect separate from the topological one.\n3. ...\n\nReaders less interested in the details can skip to the last subsection of this section =link= and the next section =link=.\n\n\nThe Quantum Hall Effect is the quantum version of the classical hall effect, a rather straightforward consequence of moving charged particles in a magnetic field. It was discovered all the way back in =XXXX= by Edwin Hall, who claimed it a novelty which would never have any use-case. Today Hall-Effect sensors are widely used to pick up magnetic fields and rotations of conducting materials. More esoteric applications are as potential long-term space-travel propellants in so-called Hall-Effect thrusters, which are a specific form of ion propolsion, which can generate a low thrust for a very long amount of time.\n\nThe basics of the effect are rather simple\n- Strip which has current flowing through it.\n- Magnetic field perpendicular to that strip\n- Induces Lorentz force which pushes particles to one side, increasing their concentration and creating a potential difference, inducing a voltage changing the resistivity.\n- This resistivity linearly depends on the voltage, which linearly depends on the concentration difference which linearly depends on the strength of the magnetic field, thus yielding a linear dependence of the resistivity to the strenght of the perpendicular magnetic field.\n- Looks like figure ref:fig:che\n\nHowever, as most classical effects, they only hold in a certain regime. When we clean up the materials, lower the temperature dramatically (<2K) and increase the magnetic field strength considerably, we observe the /Quantum Hall Effect/ (QHE): rather than a linear dependence on the magnetic field strength, the resistivity shows these strange plateaux at rather consistent values, as in ref:fig:qhe. The spacing between these plateaux does not seem to differ between different materials, which is even more curious.\n\nSo: why? Why do we see these plateaux, and why at these levels? The short answer (partially) is: the impurities in the sample lift the degeneracy of the eigenstates of the Quantum Hall system, called Landau levels, and /localizes/ some of those states, rather than the states extending from one edge of the sample to the other (akin to the wavefunctions of a particle in a box). These localized states do not conduct current (as do not span the system, and resistivity is measured from end to end), thus leading to the plateaux in the resistivity: we change plateaux when all the localized states are filled and we move to different extended states. The specific values of these levels depend on weird physics at the boundaries of the system called /edge-modes/, but in short the levels correspond to the number of filled Landau levels: at higher magnetic field strengths the levels can accommodate more states, thus the lower the magnetic field strength the larger the number of available levels, leading to a smooth-looking linear dependence in the classical regime.\n\nThere are quite some caveats to the above story, but that is the gist of why the effect happens for /integer levels/. The less interested reader can skip over the following section describing the corresponding /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/ (IQHE) and head to the description of its fractional cousin, where the same does not hold. Specifically, the IQHE requires one massive idealization: electron interaction is neglected completely. As we shall see, this idealization cannot hold in the FQHE.\n\n[fn:1] If the reader was not aware of this yet, the author does hold such inclinations.\n\n** The Integer Quantum Hall Effect\n\nIn order to do as little physics as is possibly required, I will skip most of the justification for the quantum formalism of the QHE (quantizing the classical Hamiltonian, finding the commutators) and many of the intermediate steps to arrive at the relevant results. I point the interested reader to [@Tong2016][[]] for a quite accessible and to [@Arovas2020] for a more thorough pedagogical discussion of these issues, and to [@Stone1992; @Prange1987; @Doucot2005] for rather complete, less pedagogical sources.\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) is the observation of plateaux in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ at regular intervals. These intervals happen to be integer multiples of the /quantum of resistance/  $R_q=\\frac{2\\pi\\hbar}{e^2}$. =check whether this is so=\n- This is rather curious, why so precise?\n- In fact, so precise that these experiments are used to determine the quantum of resistance.\n- Why are they there, and why at those levels?\n\nAs physicists, the first thought as to the origin of these plateaux probably goes to the energy eigenstates of the system, which turns out to be correct! The plateaux correspond to the general energy eigenstates of a system of charged particles moving in a perpendicular magnetic field, so called Landau levels.\n- It will be difficult to properly understand the QHE without first briefly going over landau levels.\n\n=Assumptions=\n\n*** Landau Levels\n\nHere we already start to sneak in our idealizations: we will treat this system as if it is two dimensional. =However, this system can be easily extended to 3D, see XXXX=\n\nThe simplest Hamiltonian for a system of particles moving in a magnetic field is\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    H=\\frac{1}{2} m(\\hat{\\mathbf{p}} +e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} )^2\n    \\label{eq:landauham}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (2)$$\n\nThe  magnetic field is perpendicular to the $x,y$-plane, so we define the vector potential $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}$ using our knowledge that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane $\\nabla\\times\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=B \\hat{z}$, to be\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\nxB\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n    \\label{eq:landaugauge}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (3)$$\n\n=This will be appendix=\nThe easiest way to find the energy eigenstates is the way all Hamiltonians get solved: treat is as the harmonic oscillator. As the Hamiltonian of the \"normal\" harmonic oscillator is\n\n\n..\n\nThese allow us to define raising and lowering operators\n=At this point we introduce new variables. These are raising and lowering operators, entirely analogous to those that we use in the harmonic oscillator. They are defined by=\n\\[a= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x - i\\pi_y) \\quad a^\\dagger = 1\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e\\hbar B}} (\\pi_x + i\\pi_y)\\]\n\nThe commutation relations for $\\pi$ then tell us that $a$ and $a^\\dagger$ obey\n\\[[a, a^\\dagger] = 1\\]\n\n\\[H= \\frac{1}{2}m \\pi^2   = \\omega_B \\left( a^\\dagger a + \\frac{1}{2}  \\right)\\]\nWe find that the energy eigenlevels are\n\\[\\ket{n}=\\omega_B\\left(n+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\]\n\n*** Calculating the degeneracy\n\nWe started by saying that the plateaux in the IQHE correspond to the various filled Landau levels of the simple particle in a magnetic field system. We still need to prove this, namely by deriving the conductivity for the Hall states. This can get rather messy, so I will show put the derivation for a single particle here, and the more general derivation of the so called /Kubo formula/ in the Appendix.\n\n=sloppy=\n\nTo find the resistivity, we use Ohm's law, which relates the energy of a particle to the current density (current over area)\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{E}=\\sigma \\mathbf{J}\n    \\label{eq:ohm}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (4)$$\n\nOur mechanical momentum is\n\\[ \\hat{\\mathbf{\\pi}}=\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}} = m \\hat{\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}}\\]\nClassically, the current (for a single particle) is simply $\\mathbf{I}=-e\\mathbf{\\dot{x}}$, but isnce we are working quantum mechanically we take the expectation value\n\n\\[I=-e/m \\sum_filled_states \\bra{\\psi}-i\\hbar\\nabla+e \\hat{\\mathbf{A}}\\ket{\\psi} \\]\n\nWe are working in Landau gauge.\n\n...\n\nWe end up with\n*** Edge modes\n\nIn order to provide a more thorough calculation (i.e. not just considering a single electron) we take advantage of a the fact that the system is bounded. I will not reproduce this here.\n\n\n*** Robutsness\n\nThe explanation above shows us why there are plateaux at the levels we see, and even gives us a hint as to why those states would be rather stable, but it has not yet told us /why/ these plateaux persist over a range of values yet, just that something is going on at those values. We have only shown that at complete filled Landau levels ($\\nu\\in \\mathbb{N}$) the longitudinal resistivity $\\rho_{xx}=0$ and that the transversal resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$ is an integer multiple of the quantum of resistance. However, if we were to move even slightly away from the completely filled Landau state where $B=\\frac{ne}{2\\pi\\hbar}\\frac{1}{\\nu}$, all our previous arguments hold no water and there is no reason to expect anything already covered to hold.\n\nThis is obviously a problem, as an effect which only shows up at a specific real number would never be experimentally observable. We will need do some dirty work in order for =this= to make sense. In fact, the solution not only requires some dirty work: the solution /is/ dirtiness.\n\nExperimental samples are inherently dirty (here meaning: containing other elements than the intended sample[fn:5]), and these impurities require us to re-examine our previous claims somewhat[fn:6]. These impurities lead to two vital insights which will allow us to solve our puzzle:\n1. They (unsurprisingly) break the degeneracy of the Landau levels, resulting in more swept out states as in ref:fig:disorder\n2. They (more surprisingly) turn many /extended/ quantum states into /localized/ ones.\n\n\n#+caption: Figure 1: <<fig:disorder>>Density of states in the IQHE with and without disorder\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:disorder\n[[file:./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n#+caption: Figure 2: <<fig:extended>>Extended to localized states\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+name: fig:extended\n[[file:./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nThis might sound all well and good, but certainly there is a limit to the amount of disorder we are allowed to introduce into our system? Surely the spokes of my bicycle should not be able to serve as Quantum Hall systems.\n\nCorrect you are: in general we demand that a) the strength of the disorder (which we model as a random potential) ought to be small relative to the Landau level splitting and b) the disorder does not dramatically vary on small scales, such that for a particle influenced by it the potential can locally be seen as constant.\nWe can express these as\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    V_{disorder}<<\\hbar\\omega_B\n    \\label{eq:disorderconstraint}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (5)$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\begin{equation}\n    | \\Delta V | <<\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_B}{l_B} |\n    \\label{eq:}\n\\end{equation} \\qquad (6)$$\n\nwhere $l_B$ is the magnetic length, =roughly the length scale at which these effects are relevant=\n\n\n\n\n\n=Now consider what this means in a random potential with various peaks and troughs. We’ve drawn some contour lines of such a potential in the left-hand figure, with + denoting the local maxima of the potential and − denoting the local minima. The particles move anti-clockwise around the maxima and clockwise around the minima. In both cases, the particles are trapped close to the extrema. They can’t move throughout the sample. In fact, equipotentials which stretch from one side of a sample to another are relatively rare. One place that they’re guaranteed to exist is on the edge of the sample.=\n\n=The upshot of this is that the states at the far edge of a band — either of high or low energy — are localised. Only the states close to the centre of the band will be extended. This means that the density of states looks schematically something like the right-hand figure=.\n\n\n\n\n=Conductivity Revisited For conductivity, the distinction between localised and extended states is an important one. /Only the extended states can transport charge from one side of the sample to the other. So only these states can contribute to the conductivity./ Let’s now see what kind of behaviour we expect for the conductivity. Suppose that we’ve filled all the extended states in a given Landau level and consider what happens as we decrease B with fixed n. Each Landau level can accommodate fewer electrons.=\n\n=But, rather than jumping up to the next Landau level, we now begin to populate the localised states. Since these states can’t contribute to the current, the conductivity doesn’t change. This leads to exactly the kind of plateaux that are observed, with constant conductivities over a range of magnetic field. So the presence of disorder explains the presence of plateaux. But now we have to revisit our original argument of why the resistivities take the specific quantised values (2.3). These were computed assuming that all states in the Landau level contribute to the current. Now we know that many of these states are localised by impurities and don’t transport charge. Surely we expect the value of the resistivity to be different. Right? Well, no. Remarkably, current carried by the extended states increases to compensate for the lack of current transported by localised states. This ensures that the resistivity remains quantised as (2.3) despite the presence of disorder=.\n\n\nI will leave the more detailed explanation for why the extended states compensate for the localized states for the interested reader, see [@Tong2016]\n\n\nThat is it for the IQHE, as we derived the two things we needed from it: we gained a general understanding of why the plateaux have their values (they are the energy eigenvalues of the Landau levels) and, more importantly, we roughly understand why these plateaux are robust.\nUnfortunately, this is not the end of the story, we did not even mention anything topological yet! For that we finally turn to the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect.\n\n[fn:5] Improved performance of impure 2D materials is an active area of research in material science, see [@Wang2020] for a summary of how impurities enhance the conductivity of graphene.\n\n[fn:6] The non-dirty sample just discussed is a great example of taking an idealization too seriously: we cannot explain the phenomena in the idealized setting, and have to retrofit extra physics on top of the idealization in order to get a satisfying explanation, only for us to then show in the limit of no impurities we regain our initial idealization. If this limit would not have been smooth (it fortunately is), we would have wasted all this time!\n\n\n** The Fractional Quantum Hall Effect\n\nFollowing the naming convention of the IQHE, the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect (FQHE) refers to the observation of plateaux at /fractional/ values of the quantum of resistance in the Hall resistivity $\\rho_{xy}$. Sadly, very few of the arguments mentioned above will be able to explain these plateaux, as we have only shown that they appear at fully filled Landau levels. However, our intuition about the robustness will still hold.\n\n\nThe goal of this expos\\'e is twofold. First we want to gain a general understanding of how the FQHE is thought about in general: what assumptions go into calculating the relevant parameters, which idealizations are noteworthy, etc. The other main goal is the 'derivation' of the Laughlin wavefunction, the wavefunction used to describe the FQH system, and its excitations. At the end we will arrive at the problem of calculating the exchange statistics of these excitations, which turn out to be /anyons/, but not actually compute them yet: this will be done in section ref:sec:GeometricPhase.\n\n\nThe key difference between the description of the Fractional as opposed to the Integer Quantum Hall effect is the inclusion of electron interactions in the former, which becomes impossible to ignore at the energy scales above $\\nu=1$, which is where most of the FQHE physics is done. As a result the reasoning cannot be as rigorous as before. In the IQHE we could pretend that all the states occupied the same Landau level, which allowed us to calculate the wavefunctions and energy levels, leading to the derivation of the Hall resistivity and confirm our suspicion that the plateaux correspond to fully filled Landau levels. Only after doing that did we let go of that idealization and allow the degeneracy to be lifted in order to argue that the plateaux were robust.\n\nThis order of operation is no longer possible in the FQHE, as the electron interactions lift the degeneracy of the Landau levels from the start, forcing us to compute the wavefunctions in a different way. A first approach would be to use perturbation theory: model the electron interaction as a small perturbation to ref:eq:landauham and then gradually compute a better and better approximation to the actual wavefunction. While this is fine for simple two-electron systems, the number of electrons in a QH system is closer to $10^{23}$. That is a rather large matrix to diagonalize, not even close to possible to do numerically. Therefore, we need to pull some tricks.\n\nThe trick is: do not compute the wave function, just write one down. That is exactly what [@Laughlin1983] did, yielding what we now call the *Laughlin wavefunction*\n\n[[id:fff6c214-ce92-4f4f-be7f-71eb21efff79][The Laughlin Wavefunction]]\n\nLaughlin of course did not just simply write down a bunch of wavefunction and pick the one he liked best, it is motivated by some observations from the system and from some general conditions we have to place on any wavefunction. Specifically, in a previous paper [@Laughlin1983a] he derived the wavefunctions for three particles in the FQHE. Recapping this in the case of two electrons is worthwhile.\n\nWe have a system of two electrons with a potential $V(|r_1-r_2|)$.\n- To solve such systems, it's easiest to work with angular momentum.\n- If we want to work with angular momentum, the gauge we picked before (Landau Gauge) is not very useful, as it does not include any kind of rotation\n  - Instead we pick /symmetric gauge/, which is $\\hat{\\mathbf{A}}=-\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\\times \\mathbf{B}= -yB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + xB/2 \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n- Skipping multiple steps ahead, we see that the wavefunctions look like\n\nUnfortunately this does not uniquely or straightforwardly generalize to N particles, so we have to pull a few more tricks.\n1. We do try to generalize, and say that a wavefunction for N particles will look something like $f(z)e^{something}$\n2. We /insist/ that the wavefunction be in the Lowest Landau Level (LLL) it can possibly be: there are no other Landau levels it can fall back on. This is rather strong. This leads to the claim that $f(z)$ /must/ be analytic. =how=\n3. Since the state will have to describe fermions, the wave function must be anti-symmetric under exchange of the particles, which requires $f(z)$ to be odd.\n4. Finally, since we need to conserve angular momentum, we require that =f(z) be a homogeneous polynomial of degree M, where M is the total angular momentum.=\n\nAll these constraints add up to the fact that $f(z)=\\prod_{j<k}(z_j-z_k)^m$, with $m$ odd.\n*This is what people mean when they say that the LWF falls into the same universality class as the actual wavefunction, as any wavefunction needs to account for this.[fn:3]*\n\nWell, neat, you might say, but this still just describes fermions, I thought we were going to be talking about anyons!

Real systems consist of a simply connected electron configuratoin space.\n2.

A nontrivial phase factor arises only over a noncontractible region. <- Topological view (according to dougherty )\n\n   So, /crucially/: Dougherty claims that we shouldn't think about configuration spaces, but about /regions/. Regions can very well differ in their connectedness/contractability, whereas configuration spaces, given that they are global things, are not.\nFurthermore, apparently we can \"/neglect the contributions from paths which intersect the shield/\", which sounds wild.

Examples I encountered include:\n+ the distinction between science and psuedoscience (Popper, Kuhn)\n+ the distinction between observables and unobservables (van Fraassen, ...)\n+ naming \"the meter\" (Wittgenstein, Kripke)\n+ measuring a \"real number\" in a physics experiment\n+ computing, producing a digital output from a continuous system\n+ ...\n\nAlso useful to keep in mind: this idea is \"essentially\" an argument against essentialism. This is a useful keyword to search for.\n* Thought\n\nIn my view, human reasoning consists of two conflicting tendencies:\n1. We wish to reason deductively and grab onto discrete, somewhat abstract propositions which we can assign truth values\n2. We wish to see \"the real world\", specifically spacetime, as continuous, in the sense that we believe it is infinitely divisible, without gaps.\n   - My hunch is that the fact that spacetime is continuous lies behind this, but the conflict might also come forth from a more general, unavoidable vagueness of concepts, see [[id:3a80df2a-77b4-4626-a9fe-933257549a07][Continuity vs. Vagueness]]\n     + Sub-hunch: the vagueness argument is more about justifying the naming of n F's as G and naming n+1 F's as H, while the continuity argument is stonger and prevents one from chopping up things into categories at all.\n\nThese are in conflict. A good way to illustrate this is analyzing the concept of a \"human\". Is it possible over all of time and space to pick out those and only those things that are humans? I don't think this is possible for many reasons:\na. Concept-wise, it is difficult to say what are humans and what are non-humans. We have two concrete cases of what are humans and what are not: associate professor Dr. Liam Bright is definitely a human, but a goldfish is definitely not. However, when exactly was the first human was born? There is a somewhat continuous line from me to a far away ancestor which we would not label human. Unless we somewhat arbitrarily draw a line, say, 2 million years ago, we cannot really pick out all the nonhumans from the humans this way.\n   + This is more related to the vagueness argument than the continuity argument, although I feel like they are the same, I should come up with a more general word for this.\n     - TODO come up with a better word for this\nb. Time-wise, it is difficult to say when even an individual human \"starts\". We have to concrete cases of when a human exists and when not: when a person is 30 years old they are definitely human that exists, but before their parents were born they definitely did not exist yet. While I myself am not in favor of arguing that life starts at conception, it seems like the only natural starting point for what constitutes an individual human, otherwise you'd have to argue for \"X\" number of cells starts to make a human, again speaking ontologically. However, even if we decide to be hardcore bible-thumpers and claim that life starts at \"conception\", when is that? Is it when the sperm touches the egg-cell? But when IS that? Since time and space are continuous, there are an uncountable number of instants in where the sperm touches the egg for the first time: there is no \"first touch\". One might be inclined to specify are period of time instead, but, as I will argue later, this is just kicking the can down the road, as the process of going from non-human to human is now just ignored over this small time interval.\nc. Space-wise, it is difficult to say where exactly a human phyiscally \"ends\". We have to concrete cases of where a human exists and when not: the center of a living human's brain is definitely part of them, but the center of the sun is definitely not. However, where EXACTLY does a human begin and end? A natural guess it at the end of their epidermis. Their epidermis is made up of molecules, and the last \"epidermis\" molecule is where the human ends. Even barring humans shedding skin and replacing their cells, the epidermis molecules is not a precise enough end. Molecules are made up of atoms, which consist of electrons and a core. We know that their relation is not as one of a sun and its planets, instead electrons are more akin to a cloud surrounding the core (which in itself is not so definitely positioned). This \"cloud\", however, extends as far space itself! Surely, the probability of finding the electron further than 1mm from the nucleus is already astronomically low, but it is non-zero. Where does one create the cut-off point? Even if one picks their favorite interpretation of QM where everything might have a definite position, then still the fact that space is continuous prevents us from creating a definite cutoff point\n   - Kind of weak near the end, specifiy further.\n\nI claim that it is not possible to assign ontological status to both. In order to reason soundly, then, we must do either one of the following\n1. Give up the idea that spacetime is fundamentally continuous. This means that there are discrete units of space and time, which we could then group and give meaning to. For instance, a human could be defined as starting to exist at conception, which would be a definite instance in time and space.\n2. Give up on the idea of ontological discrete groupings/concepts. Ontologically, there is no such thing as a human. While many might be willing to bite that particular bullet, this has far reaching consequences. Almost nothing would be justifiably ontologically real, except those things that could be mapped to the continuum of spacetime and exists on the same \"level\" as it. Basically, we can reason, but all our categories would be fundamentally arbitrary. This does not mean they are not useful, but that they cannot be part of the ontological furniture of the world.\n(3. Reason \"continuously\". If we were somehow able to reason just using continuous arguments, this might work. However, I don't know what this looks like.)\n\n* Refs\nThis topic is deeply related to a breadth of other topics.

Supervaluationism then introduces two new concepts: super-truth and super-falsity\n\n** Supers\n\n*** super truth\n\nA statement containing a vague predicate is super true if(f?) the statement is true under all admissable precifications.\n\n\"A person with no hairs on their head is bald\" is then super true, because every way of precisifying \"is bald\" would include the case of a person with literally no hair on their head.\n\n*** Super falsity\n\nJust the same but the other way around\n\"A person with 1 milliion hairs on their head is bald\" is super false, because every way of precisifying \"is bald\" would rule out the caase of a person with 1 million hairs on their head.\n\n*** borderliners\n\nThe only ill defined cases then are those which are not super true or super false i.e. those that are only true under some precisifications and false under others, such as having 10,000 hairs on ones head.\n\n**   Logic\nSupervalationism is compatible with classical logic, as we can just equate super truth to truth and super falsitity to falsity.\n\nI don't know what we do with borderliners.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210119122414-idealizations_should_be_distinguished_by_outcome_not_by_operation.org","oid":"92f244ad2a0e44c6c1ec39512160f3cf969ab085","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       0b697698-9e37-4bd7-a833-5580e878925e\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200854\n:ctime:    20210119122414\n:"},{"count":1170,"value":"END:\n#+title: idealizations should be distinguished by outcome, not by operation\n#+filetags: claim thesis idealizations\n\n* Context\n\nWhen idealization is discussed by for instance [[id:26cf4180-c383-462c-8a35-2698bc11003a][Strevens2019a: The structure of asymptotic idealization]] or cite:Norton2012 , I have difficulty knowing what they are exactly talking about, see [[id:f25a5d3d-a827-462a-b5a3-eca42fd966c0][confusing approximations and idealizations]]. This note is an attempt to clarify what the problem is and how to tackle it.\n\n* Body\n\nThe problem with Streven's, Norton's and perhaps Batterman's discussions about infinite idealizations or asymptotic idealizations, is that they distinguish infinite idealizations from other things, be that normal idealizations or approximations, by the operation by which they are achieved, BUT then discuss the merits or results of that operation, which then invariably introduces another distinction: between infinite idealizations which do not smoothly approach the limit, and everything else. The latter is generally seen to be unproblematic, at least in the sense that scientific representation or modelling is assumed to be unproblematic. The former is where the difficulties lie and where disagreement arises, at least in the context of the discussion on infinite idealizations. Few people would disagree with Norton by saying that approximations are something else, they disagree that all infinite idealizations can be explained away as approximations, namely those infinite idealizations that do not smoothly approach the limit.\n\nI propose therefore that, in discussions about infinite idealizations, we distinguish first and formost between the following (nomenclature subject to revision):\n\n** Disinction\n*** Continuous operations\nNon discontinuous operations, converging limits, non-problematic idealizations, approximations etc. all fall in this class. They are relatively unproblematic, in the sense that there is no major dispute about whether or not the ought to be used at all or whether they /are/ used in science. They include Norton's approximations and Streven's simple idealizations, but also Norton's converging infinite idealizations and Strevens' \"non-interesting\" asymptotic idealization.\n\n*** Discontinuous operations\nThis is just the class of those infinite/asymptotic idealizations which do not smoothly approach the limit. I think this is the interesting class, and the one we should distinguish.\n\n** Merit\n\nThe merit of this approach, I claim, is that we now both distinguish between the operation which arrives at these idealization as well as their result, and thus do not get bogged down with discussions or distractions about the \"easily understood\" idealizations belonging to the class of infinite idealizations. It just doesn't make sense to look at them like that.\n\n** Disadvantage\n\na) This distinction doesn't say anything specific about WHAT is discontinuous, it matters a lot which property you're looking at I think\nb) This distinction groups a lot of things together under \"continuous\", operations and concepts between which we can distinguish further. Approximations are not idealizations and it is useful to note the difference, but the problem with distinguishing only arises when (in this case) the promotion relation doesn't work. This failure of promotion is the interesting factor, not the conceptualization of an idealization as separate model. While this conceptualization is interesting to talk about, it is not what is at stake, and Norton's distinction has done some harm in this regard.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210204155921-if_you_cant_loop_back_to_your_introduction_make_shit_up_in_your_conclusion.org","oid":"748cd5cd439285ce47b12e80678633e71ea32e84","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       f5e4542f-0c24-4f50-bdfc-5e6d39ab8001\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200845\n:ctime:    20210204155921\n:"},{"count":416,"value":"END:\n#+title: if you cant loop back to your introduction, make shit up in your conclusion\n#+filetags: writing thesis\n\n* Context\n\nHad a chat with Guido and Ronnie about my thesis, where we discussed my introduction ([[id:fc0a61f3-2c05-4c30-ac48-08b84203010a][Proselike introduction v1]]).

Crucially, one rather popular explanation of the FQHE necessarily employs an infinitesimal idealization, namely that the configuration space of the electrons involved is 2D. The configuration space of electrons is always 3D, so this is a classic example of an idealization as a fiction used to explain something. However, contra cite:Strevens2019a, I argue that this idealization cannot be construed as one which gets rid of a variable irrelevant to the explanation, as this infinite idealization is /crucial/ to the whole explanation: without it there is no explanation.\n\nBut, I am getting ahead of myself. The FQHE is not easily summarized in a short paragraph, and the rest of this chapter will be dedicated to providing a rudimentary understanding of the effect and its \"causes\".\n\n\n** The [[id:8fc72829-7ad9-4c8a-b400-229add0957bb][classical hall effect]]\n\nBefore we start to describe the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect, we should first understand Quantum Hall effects more generally. To do /that/, a short description of the classical Hall Effect is in order.\n\nThe classical Hall effect can be briefly described as the measurement of a voltage /across/ (transversally) a thin conducting plate trough which a current is run in the longitudinal direction and which is subject to a magnetic field perpendicular to both, as in Figure \\ref{fig:che}\n\n#+caption: set up of the che, stolen from cite:Shech2019\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:che\n[[./media/che.png]]\n\nClassically, we can explain the observation of this voltage by the fact that the electrons travelling in the longitudinal direction experience a Lorentz force $\\textbf{F} = q\\textbf{E} + q\\textbf{v} \\times \\textbf{B}$, which causes them to be redirected to one of the sides of the plate. This leads to a gradient of electrons along the transversal axis, i.e. a voltage difference. Instead of a voltage, the resistance is usually measured.\n\nThe classical Hall effect is relatively well understood and, frankly, quite boring.\n\nThe classical quantum hall effect happens around .......\n\n* The Quantum Hall Effect(s)\n:LOGBOOK:\nCLOCK: [2021-03-09 Tue 09:51]\n:END:\n\nThings start to get more interesting once the strength of the magnetic field is increased quite a bit. We start to observe plateaux at regular intervals in the transversal resistance.\n#+caption: qhe\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:iqhe\n[[./media/iqhe.png]]\n\nWe would of course like to know what explains the appearance of these plateaux.\n\nAt even stronger magnetic fields and even cleaner samples, we start to see even more plateaux.\n\n\n...\n\nLet us first focus our attention on the lower magnetic field range, which gives rise to the socalled /Integer Quantum Hall Effect/. First observed in XXXX by YY, the effect gets its name from the plateaux appearing at integer multiples of the \"quantum of resistance\".\n\n** Quantum of Resistance\n\n\\[R_q=e^2\\hbar/2\\pi\\]\n\n\nThis is strange, as from the classical quantum hall effect we expect the transversal resistance to vary linearly with the strength of the magnetic field.\n\n** Landau levels\n\nThe IQHE comes from the impurities present in the sample: the \"pure\" energy eigenstates of the system would not lead plateaux. The impurities can be modeled as a random potential. This random potential breaks the degeneracy of the Landau levels and \"smooths them out\", like\n#+caption: smooth landau, stolen from Tong.\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:nondegenlandau\n[[./media/broadlandau.png]]\n\n\nIn addition, the disorder causes the energy levels to be split up into /extended/ and /localized/ energy states, like\n#+caption: extended v localized, also Tong\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:extended v localized\n[[./media/breakdegen.png]]\n\n\nOnly the extended energy levels carry current, the localized ones do not. Furthermore, the extended ones are favored? In any case, as the magnetic field strength increases, so does the energy of the states, so they get pushed up to a new energy level. However, they first have to fill the localized states before they are able to reach a new extended state, and all these localized states do not conduct i.e. do not contribute to the conductivity i.e. do not change the resistance of the material. Tada, you got plateaux.\n\nAt this point one may have some questions: these extended states sound like they are about the longitudinal resistance, not the transversal. Furthermore, if the extended states gets less populated and the localized states more populated over the course of a plateaux, why does the resistivity not just shoot up since there are so many less conductive states?\n\nThe answer to the latter is that the extended states will end up conducting more, somehow.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210309112810-infinite_idealizations_resemble_sorites_because_both_have_discontinuous_transitions.org","oid":"3ba045913ce43f78215c79723b6ff287ff798bfa","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       37bfaecb-92e6-4cd7-9735-2b6c940c0e03\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200824\n:ctime:    20210309112810\n:"},{"count":952,"value":"END:\n#+title: Infinite idealizations resemble Sorites because both have discontinuous transitions\n#+filetags: vagueness central thesis\n\n\n* Context\n\nMy thesis heavily centers around two topics: [[id:4d1d4b14-fb53-41d2-bc0d-a1c197cc6df0][infinite idealizations]] and [[id:2bd50b77-d226-4853-8bf2-d0e69b570a53][vagueness]]/[[id:207301aa-718d-417a-b3c0-103264d7a88f][sorites paradox]].

I am stuck writing [[id:edfca3ee-eb93-46ff-8e10-25794e4cd67e][FQHE Intro to show Ronnie and Guido]]\n\n* Infinite Idealizations are similar to Sorites paradoxes because both are mathematical/logical reasons for why common explanations of phenomena don't (immediately) work out\n\nVagueness/Sorites paradox is having a continuous or discrete transition from one concept/object/... to another, where at the one end a predicate is true and at the other a predicate is false, and there being equally good reasons for believing that neither predicate actually can change.\n\nExample:\n1. A man with 100000 hairs is not bald.\n2. If a man with N hairs is not bald, a man with N-1 hairs is not bald.\n   ...\n3. A man with 0 hairs is not bald.\n\n3 seems false, but 1 seems true, so to fix this we can negate 2.\n1. A man with 100000 hairs is not bald.\n2. \\not 2\n3. There is a point at which a man with N hairs is not bald but at N-1 is bald.\n\n3 seems false again, this time illustrating that we do not believe we can't draw lines that well.\n\nNow for Inf Ids.\n\n1. We do not observe the FQHE normally because the configuration space of the electrons is 3D\n2. If the configuration space is 3D at n thickness/magnetic field strength, then the configuration space is 3D at n/2 thickness/ 2n magnetic field strength.\n...\n3. We never observe the FQHE\n\nOr, other way around again\n\n1. 1.\n2. \\not 2\n...\n3. There is a point where n thickness/magnetic field strength does not yield the FQHE, but n/2 thickness/ 2n magnetic field strength does.\n\n3 also seems objectionable here, as we don't believe this symmethy is this easily broken\n\n\n\n* THE MAJOR SIMILARITY IS THAT FOR BOTH CASES WE DO NOT HAVE A MECHANISM FOR DETERMINING /WHEN/ THIS CHANGE WOULD OCCUR.\n\nSo if the vagueness paradox is a problem for baldness than it is also a problem for this.\n\nAh.

In 3 dimensions there appear to be only two kinds of quantum statistics possible: Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, giving rise to bosons and fermions respectively. A particle with fractional statistics, then, has any statistics which differ from bosons and fermions, giving rise to particles which can take on /any/ phase factor, and therefore aptly named \"anyons\".\n\nA particle's quantum statistics are also intimately tied to its spin, but we can ignore that for now.\n\n** There are two ways of thinking about fractional statistics: operator and configuration space\n\nHow do we know that only anyons and bosons are allowed in 3 dimensions?\nWe have two frameworks for deriving the allowed (or possible) quantum statistics of a particle, the operator framework and the configuration space framework. However, while they are equivalent in 3D (cite:Landsman2016b), they offer different predictions in 2D.\n\nAs mentioned, previously, quantum statistics concern the phase factor a system of identical particles picks up when exchanged, and this exchange can be modeled in two ways using the above framework.\n\nUsing the operator framework, we model this exchange of particles by swapping out all of their quantum numbers, turning one particle into the other so to say, which clearly involves the precise workings of the operators, while for the configuration space approach we /physically/ swap out said particles, a procedure which heavily depends on the characteristics of said particles configuration space.\n\n** Naive exchange\n\nIn order to prepare ourselves for the more in depth analysis to follow, it is worth looking at the handwavey approach to solving particle exchange first (this technically works with distinguishable particles but it works as a first approximation):\n\nWe start out with a wavefunction $\\Psi$ of our system of two particles $\\psi_1$ and $\\psi_2$\n\\[\\Psi_0=\\psi_1\\psi_2\\]\n\nIf we exchange the particles, we expect them to pick up a certain [[id:4b10bcb4-8337-4b3e-be7a-adab788f995c][phase transitions]]\n\n\\[\\Psi_\\pi=e^{i\\theta\\pi}\\psi_2\\psi_1\\]\n\nExchanging them again, we have arrive at the same position as before, and, with the particles being indistinguishable, we expect the system to be identical to the one we started with\n\n\\[\\Psi_{2\\pi}=e^{i2\\pi\\theta}\\Psi_0\\]\n\nTherefore, $e^{i2\\pi\\theta}=1 \\rightarrow e^{i\\pi\\theta}=\\pm 1$, which leads to $\\theta=0 \\lor \\theta=1$.\n\nWe have therefore \"shown\" that there are only to types of particles possible, bosons ($\\theta=0$) and fermions ($\\theta=1$). In relativistic quantum mechanics we can prove that this leads to bosons having integer and fermions having half integer spin, but for now we can be content with assuming this.\n\n** The operator framework (I am really quite certain that this is not \"the operator framework\" )\n\nWhat we saw above is a very crude version of the operator framework approach, we will go over in more detail now. This starts from the assumption that spin labels different kinds of particles, and then 'shows' that only integer and half integer spin particles can exist.\n\n(Just taken from cite:Rao2001 for clarity, not sure how to incorporate this yet)\n\nThe three spatial components of spin obey the following commutation relation\n\n\\begin{equation}\n[S_i,S_j]=i\\varepsilon_{ijk}S_K\n    \\label{eq:spincomm}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nIf we take the state $\\ket{s,m}$  and have the spin operators act like\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^2\\ket{s,m}=s(s+1)\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:spinsquared}\n\\end{equation}\n\nand\n\\begin{equation}\nS_3\\ket{s,m}=m\\ket{s,m}\n    \\label{eq:s3}\n\\end{equation}\n\nthen we can define the action of a spin raising operator $S^+$ as\n\n\\begin{equation}\nS^+\\ket{s,m}=[s(s+1)-m(m+1)]^{1/2}\\ket{s,m+1}=\\ket{s,m'}\n    \\label{eq:splus}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf we require $\\sqrt{|\\ket{s,m'}|^2}>0$, we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\ns(s+1)-m(m+1)\\geq0 \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:posnorm}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus\n\\begin{equation}\nm\\leq s \\quad \\forall m\n    \\label{eq:ms}\n\\end{equation}\n\nIt is clear then, that for some $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $m'=m+n>s$, unless $m'=s$, so\n\\begin{equation}\ns-m= n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:int}\n\\end{equation}\n\nSimilarly from $S^-$ we can arrive at\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s=n\\in \\mathbb{N}\n    \\label{eq:mpluss}\n\\end{equation}\n\nCombining \\eqref{eq:int} and \\eqref{eq:mpluss},  we get\n\n\\begin{equation}\nm+s+s-m=2s=n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow s=\\frac{n}{2}\n    \\label{eq:proofofinteger}\n\\end{equation}\nSince $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $s$ can only be integer or halfinteger.\n\nSo, just using the spin commutation relations we have shown that in 3+1D there can only be two kinds of spin particles, which we know to identify as bosons and fermions.\n\n*** I am not really sure that this has anything to do with the operator framework, we are simply using operators so I just assumed, but that is not really a good argumeng\n\n*** TODO Spin statistics relation\n\n\n** Configuration space framework\n\nThe above outline works for 3D, but not really for 2 dimensions, as we only have one spin direction (the one perpendicular to the plane) and therefore there are no commutations relations to specify. We could interpret this as the spin having no constraint and thus being able to take on any value, but this does not feel like a proper argument nor does it guarantee anything about the phase.\n\nLuckily, the configuration space framework is here to alleviate all our worries. The approach is rather straightforward but powerful nonetheless, as follows\n\n1. Construct the configuration space of the system of exchanging indistinguishable particles\n2. Find the fundamental group of that configuration space\n3. The 1D representation of that group is the phase factor of the exchange\n\nIt almost seems too easy.\n\nLet's construct the configuration space for exchange of $2$ identical particles in $d$ dimensions (this can be done for $N$ particles as well but the notation is much simpler this way).\n\nWithout any constraints on the ways the particles behaved, the configuration space of would be the vector space of the two $d$-dimensional position vectors $(r_1,r_2)$, which would be\n\\[\\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\mathbb{R}^d\\]\n\nHowever, as the particles are indistinguishable, $(r_1,r_2)= (r_2,r_1)$ (here we are strictly talking about there /configuration/ space, not the /phase/ or state space of the system, i.e. only the actual positions of the particles are under consideration.) This results in us dividing out the permutation group $S_N$, and since for us $N=2$, we divide out $S_2=Z_2$, effectively cutting the configuration space in twain.\n\n\n\nWe need to impose another constraint, namely to excise the diagonal points $r_1=r_2$. (As far as I have seen this is argued for rather weakly, with cite:Rao2001 saying it is because we want to keep track of exchanges, and if they are identical we obviously are not able to do so, and cite:Shech2019,Shech2015b arguing that we need to excise these points as otherwise we cannot have fermions. Both of these arguments include some mumbling about how this does not really affect bosons since their phase is 1 anyway, but I find this rather weak justification, and to me it sounds kind of ad hoc.  )\n\nLet us call the set of diagonal points $\\Delta$. To further simplify our space a bit, instead of keeping track of both of our particles, we can keep track of their center of mass (CM) $\\mathbf{R}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})}{2}$ and the distance between them $\\mathbf{r}=(\\mathbf{r_1}-\\mathbf{r_2})$.\n\n\nThen, for our configuration space looks like\n\\begin{equation}\nQ= \\mathbb{R}^d \\times \\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d  - \\Delta }{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:confspaceddim}\n\\end{equation}\n\n# =just blantantly copied=\nIn order to study the phase picked up by the WF of a particle as it moves around the other we need to /classify all possible *closed* paths/ in the configuration space. To make our lives even easier, since we are only interested in the phase of the particles we can \"discard\" the position of the CM, as this simply shifts their combined position in space which we assume does not change the phase the two particles add acquire. Thus, we can only look at the paths in\n\\begin{equation}\nS=\\frac{\\mathbb{R}^d -\\Delta}{Z_2}\n    \\label{eq:S}\n\\end{equation}\n\nBefore showing what the fundamental group of this space is, we can get a more intuitive notion of possible paths a particle can take by keeping $|r|$ fixed so that $S$ describes the surface of a $d$-dimensional sphere. We can easily see this by....\n\n*** 3D\nLet's stay at $3$ dimensions for now. The paths $S$ are then all the possible paths along a half-sphere (because of the division by $Z_2$) of radius $|r|\\neq 0$ (because of the excision of $\\Delta$, which for $\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{r}_1 -\\mathbf{r}_2$ is $0$ by definition).\n\n[[./media/3dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 3D exchange of identical particles with $|r|$ fixed\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\n\n=Copying again=\n\nAn exchange of particles will then look like moving the tip of $\\mathbf{r}$ from one side of the sphere to the other (path B). A double exchange will then be \"looping it around\" the sphere (path C).\n\nWhat is very important is that path C can be *continually shrunk to a point (imagine a string wrapped around the equator of a sphere getting moved up and pulled tighter and tighter), while path B cannot (as its endpoints are fixed)*. =This means that while path B can induce a nontrivial phase difference, path C cannot and thus the WF should be the same for a double exchange=.\n\nNow we have provided a clearer justification for the handwavey argument given in Section X: one exchange provides a phase factor, say $\\alpha$, and two exchanges brings us back to the origin, so\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha^2=+1 \\rightarrow \\alpha = \\pm 1\n    \\label{eq:doubleexchange}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThus, in 3 dimensions only Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are possible.\n\n\n*** 2D\n\nLet us move to the actual goal, 2 dimensions. Same as before, if we fix $|r|$ we get a 2D sphere (a circle) with it's endpoints identified.\n\n[[./media/2dexchange.png]]\n#+caption: 2D exchange\n#+attr_latex: scale=0.75\n#+label: fig:2dexchange\n\nWe make the same argument as before: since in path B the endpoints are fixed, it clearly cannot be contracted to a point, therefore taking on a nontrivial phase.\n\nHowever, path C also cannot be contracted to a single point, as it is fixed on the circle. One may object that the circle presentation here is just an artifact of laziness, which is entirely correct. However, the point $r=(0,0)$ is still excised, so the \"string\" cannot collapse to single point in principle.\n\nTherefore, while the particle picks up a phase $\\alpha$ during one exchange, it picks up a phase $\\alpha^2$ in a double exchange, which is also nontrivial i.e. $\\neq 1$. It is thus apparent that $\\alpha$ can be any real value, as we do not have any constraint on it. We only know that $\\alpha$ has no effect on $|\\Psi|^2$ and therefore can be written as\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\alpha = e^{i\\theta}\n    \\label{eq:phasephase}\n\\end{equation}\n\n\n\n\n*** Connection to the Braid group\n\nThe above explanation might be satisfactory to some, but a crucial piece of information is still missing: why does the fact that a particle cannot contract to a single point, i.e. whether or not the space is [[id:2e0a3a59-3794-4b5f-8313-f630d88a7a87][Simply connected]], affect the phase of the system in any way? The answer lies in a theorem????\n\nQuantum statistics of a particle are the 1D representation of the [[id:803d6df6-3d4c-4471-b3bd-a022fad8d1ee][First homotopy group pi_1]]/[[id:a07166f2-4a5c-40e6-a312-bc04b1b3d97e][fundamental group]] of the configuration space.\n\n# (Why are the QS that?

This phase is obtained when a state is transported along parameter space from its starting position and back again, completing a loop.\n\n* The importance of the adiabatic theorem\n\n  The adiabatic theorem seems to be important for the computation of the Berry phase, serving a similar role as \"parallel\" in [[id:71b7fa31-7712-4a3a-a3ff-825298ed86cd][Parallel transport]]: by keeping the system in the same phase, we can reasonably talk about its phase difference and discard the phase evolution. But, this only happens in the limit of the state being transformed infinitely slowly.\n\n  =Luckily, this limit is smoothly approached, just as it is for parallel transport: if we don't keep the vector /precisely/ parallel but only approximatley, we still get some angle difference despite us not being perfect.=\n\n\n* Berry phase calculation in 2D\n\n  Here we calculate the Berry phase over the Berry Connection\n\n  ...\n=ADD EXPLANATION THAT SHOWS THIS=\n\n\n  We see that we still get a discontinuous jump at $k=2\\pi$ when the loop comes back around, which does not seem like an improvement from our topological example, the only thing we have changed is instead of talking about topology we talk about geometry.\n\n  However, this is in fact quite the improvement, because geometry can be somewhat more easily be changed than topology (cutting a hole in a space is more difficult than making it a bit smoother). We will look at an example\n\n* The Cone Example and Holonomy\n\n  The initial way of calculating the Berry phase shows that we still get a discontinuous jump, which is bad. Here we will see that sometimes this can be removed, by looking at the parallel transport of a vector around a cone.\n\n  Parallel transport is a bit strange. On a flat Euclidean plane, nothing happens.\n  A cone is like a flat Euclidean plane glued together in a weird way, like this\n\n[[./media/conefold.png]]\n\nWhere side $s$ is glued to side $?$ in order to yield a smooth surface, with the exception of the problematic point $S$.\n\nWe can then calculate our parallel transport by simply \"doing\" the parallel transport on the surface of the \"flat\" cone.\n\nThe vector is transport from the one side to the other, eventually reaching the edge $s$, from where it is suddenly teleported to $s$, ending up with a much different angle.\n\n[[./media/transport.jpeg]]\nhttps://www.physicsforums.com/threads/parallel-transport-and-cone.1000209/\n\n\nThis angle difference is directly related to the angle of the cone. We see that the sharper the cone, the bigger the failure of parallel transport (holonomy) will be.\n\nThe strange thing is, of course, that this angle difference appears rather suddenly only after we completed >1 round. However, were we to move an 'actual' vector on a cone, we'd expect this to happen slowly, right? We want to get rid of the \"discontinuous jump\".\n\nThis question proves rather difficult to answer, for two reasons.\n1. The holonomic angle is only defined when the vector returns to its original position, we don't expect thing to be the same when we simply stop the transport somewhere in the middle.\n2. Actual cones are not this pointy.\n\nhttp://applet-magic.com/paralleltransport.htm\n\nIn actuality, when you deform the cone in the figure above, the angle /does/ change continuously along the path of the cone wrt beginning angle, but that's very often the case and does not count.\n\nInstead of having the continuous parameter be the angle of the cone, a better one would be the \"path\", since we are interested in paths after all. Here we see that if we take any path that does not cross the \"seam\", the angle remains 0. But the seam is kind of arbitrary, so that is not really fair.\nWe do know, however, that if the path encircles the tip of the cone it definitely passes the seam. So now we have our discontinuity: all paths that do not cross the tip do not gain a holomorphic angle (because those paths are the same as paths in Euclidean spacetime), while as soon as the path encompasses the origin it has to cross the seam and thus gains an angle $\\phi$.\n\nSince this failure of parallel transport is a geometric property, we say that all the geometric information of the cone is centered in one point, because inclusion of that point in the path makes or breaks the angle.\n\n** Less pointy cone\n\n\n   As we see, the thing we then need to change in order to get a more smooth cone holonomy is the tip. At the moment we have only one point which is problematic. This can be seen as our idealization: an infinitely sharp cone instead of a blunt one.\n\n   When we blunt the cone, we suddenly see that the path can be continuously deformed to include the \"seam\". However, what we have gained in smoothness we have lost in mathematical simplicity: we no longer can easily relate the cone to the Euclidean plane. In order to describe the blunt cone, we need to describe it's /connection/ and do some differential geometry.\n\n   ...\n\n   Now we see that the cone is good.\n\n* Relating this back to anyons\n\n  The case with anyons is similar: we calculate the geometric phase using the fact that the space has one anomolous point, namely the spot where the other particle is. How do we go about making this less problematic?\n\n cite:Ong2006 gives an explanation of things.\n\n\n\n=COPY PASTE TONGS EXPLANATION IN THE PREVIOUS CHAPTER LIKE SHAHIN SUGGESTED=\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210525170640-overdescription_gauge_cover_ing_space.org","oid":"33738ef89b2ab98b22bb6f04de57ed14fe313c3f","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       0f439030-4c44-4c62-88a1-eca8e027a3da\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200717\n:ctime:    20210525170640\n:"},{"count":278,"value":"END:\n#+title: Underdescription = gauge = cover(ing space)\n#+filetags: physics mathematics gauge philosophy\n\n* Underdescription = gauge = cover(ing space)\n\nWhat philosophers call \"underdescription\", physicists call [[id:fab92aca-8392-49e1-8c66-922fc37d77a1][gauge freedom]], and mathematicians (roughly) call a [[id:32d4f910-5305-4e22-886f-5f823172aca3][Cover]]: they all describe a larger space which maps onto a smaller space which we actually care about.\n\nThis is not completely fair, as underdescription is the most general, gauge is more specific and cover is super specific.\n\nBut it works: a theory which underdescribes phenomena can map onto several more specific theories, a theory with a gauge freedom map onto several specific theories, and a space can be a cover for several spaces.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210601145636-dimensionality_of_an_electron_gas_is_determined_by_fermi_surface_topology.org","oid":"2bba364c3861802285c156c7057329d196b2bb49","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       8884ca0d-a2b7-4021-8668-a54d7a8267c8\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200715\n:ctime:    20210601145636\n:"},{"count":319,"value":"END:\n#+title: Dimensionality of an electron gas is determined by Fermi Surface topology\n#+filetags: anyons 2DEG FQHE 3DQHE\n\n* Dimensionality of an electron gas is determined by Fermi Surface topology\n\nAfter looking into the [[id:0448eeeb-d0dc-45ca-a850-caa8413b3640][3D Quantum Hall Effect]] a little bit, it seems that physicists determine the dimensionality of an electron gas by looking at the topology of its [[id:5e598557-43cc-48c3-ad9d-6b9c639214df][Fermi Surface]] (what that is I don't yet know.)\n\nSpecifically, cite:Tang2019 claims \"quasi-2D and 3D systems are distinguished by their Fermi surface topology: whereas for quasi-2D systems the Fermi surface is open along the stacking direction, it is closed for 3D systems\" when discussing whether two 2D QHE systems stacked on top of each other is the same as a 3D one.\n\n  cite:Pavlosiuk2017 talks about the surface topology.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210606144410-critique_of_the_configuration_space_explanation.org","oid":"3e8cb44cdfe397e6eea500b0f824074b4543e52c","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       9a102d0f-bbd5-421d-af39-854eb34cb8a3\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701200711\n:ctime:    20210606144410\n:"},{"count":5181,"value":"END:\n#+title: Critique of the configuration space explanation\n#+filetags: subchapter anyons\n\n\n* COMMENT Critique\n\nThe main crux of my critique lies in the (in my eyes) unnecessary assumption that the quantum statistics of a particle can /only/ be determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space. While this might work as a prediction, i.e. if we can figure out the configuration space and then the fundamental group, we might reasonably expect to find particles with such and such quantum statistics there.\n\nHowever, I do not find this very satisfactory as an explanation, it feels much too close to a DN way of explaining things, which, as we know [[id:0efec85b-7a67-4c32-9760-73a6f663e713][DN cannot determine whether something is a difference maker]]. That is, the explanation works backwards: instead of ending uncontrovertably with the most controversial point, namely that the configuration space of the anyons is 2D, it arrives there kind of casually.\n\n\n\nThe order of explanation as it is usually given is like this:\n1. We have observed fractional quantum statistics (alledgedly, i'm willing to grant that at this point)\n2. /The quantum statistics of the particle are determined by the first homotopy group of its configuration space/\n3. The 1D rep of the Braid group is fractional quantum statistics\n4. The Braid group is the first homotopy group of a non-simply connected 2D configuration space\n5. Therefore particles which exhibit fractional quantum statistics need to have a 2D configuration space\n\n\nNow, if all of the above steps /necessarily/ are /if and only ifs/, this argument is rather water tight. However, I would dispute that this is the case here, first and foremost on the grounds that this conclusion is /primae facie/ unacceptable and a paradox, so something seems to go wrong here. We can either resolve this paradox by correcting our physics to allow for precisely 2D configuration spaces, or, what seems more agreeable to me, by not allowing the argument to reach this conclusion, as I do not believe every single on of the steps above are if and only ifs.\n\nSpecifically, I have trouble with step 2, as we appear to need some theorem in order to establish this but I have not really found such a theorem, just vague gestures to the fact that these statistics come from the worldlines being intertwined and whatnot.\n\nThe other way around the explanation looks a lot less secure\n\n1. The configuration space describing the exchange of two identical particles contains a hole in the origin and is thus non-simply connected\n2. Such a space has an infinite number of homotopy classes of equivalent (i.e. continuously deformable into each other) paths\n3. The fundamental group/first homotopy group of these paths is the Braid group\n4. The 1D rep of this group is $e^{i\\theta}$\n5. /This is the spin of the particles we are interested in/\n\n\n** The problem with treating this as a DN explanation\n\nThe problem with treating this a DN explanation is that that requires that the Laws of Nature used are true and ALSO the events described as premises. However, there are not really any of the latter, as we can't take the existence of a 2D things as a premise, as that is weird.\n\n[[id:76a2711e-8e05-4058-9808-3cefeffce717][EIA allows us to verify DN premises]]\n\n\n** COMMENT Brief critique summary\n\n** Leng says: \"Platonism is not real, because we can just say that physical space approximately instantiates mathematical structures, so we don't need that exactness\"\n\n** Shech says: \"We cannot use approximate instantiation if we assume approximation means how Norton says it and if we use the EIA.

The way I see it, Shech's explanation resembles a DN explanation but backwards: we observe the explandum, from the assume that the explanans is ciorrcet, and view the explanans as a chain of laws (theorems) leading to the final claim that the configuration space of the system must be exactly 2D. One might object against this IBE style approach, but I will not challenge it here.\n\nInstead, I will challenge one of the assumptions underlying this approach, namely that all the deductive steps taken to get from point A to B are necessary connections. I agree with Shech that 3D space cannot instantiate the Braid group directly, as his argument shows. However, there is a catch with these kinds of idealization arguments, namely that the failure of promotion is /depends on the property under consideration/. Connectedness is such binary property which lends itself especially well to such failures: either all the paths can be deformable to a point or they cannot, no ifs ands or buts. But connectedness is a rather abstract property regardless, much further removed from direct measurement than the quantities we are actually interested in: the statistics of the system. Demanding that connectedness be the make-or-break property seems a little unfair to me, as whether abstract mathematical structures can be said to be instantiated by the physical systems is the problem under question in the first place. While I would not dare go as far a to accuse Shech of begging the question, I do believe it allows me some wiggle room for finding an alternative route.\n\nWith \"finding an alternative route\", I mean going over the deductive structure outlined above and finding either alternative ways to characterize what is happening to actually be approximate rather than exact, or to find an alternative explanation /qua/ deductive argument starting from different premises which do not have such a problematic explanation. As an illustration, consider the well worn counter-example against the DN model of Bob (someon without a uterus) not getting pregant after taking anti-conception medication.\n1. Bob takes anti-conception pills\n2. If you take anti-conception pills, you will not become pregnant\nC. Bob does not become pregnant.\n\nWhile we know that the DN model of explanation cannot call this an incorrect explanation by itself, we do recognize this as an incorrect explanation, as Bob would not have become pregnant anyway since Bob does not have a uterus. Thus the explanation is in some way deficient, which different models of explanation have tried to solve in different ways. The exact solution does not matter to us at this point, what is important is the diagnosis of the problem and the ways this explanation could be improved. For one, we could replace 1 and 2 with different claims entirely, such as \"Bob does not have a uterus\" and \"If you do not have a uterus you cannot become pregnant\" respectively. Or, we could modify 2. slightly and use assumptions implicit in 1 to come to the same conclusion, such as \"If you take anti-conception pills /or/ do not have a uterus you will not become pregnant\". Since the fact that Bob does not have a uterus is implicit in 1. (else, why would it not be a correct explanation?), we can add it as another premise, completing the argument. Let us see what such an argument could look like in our case.\n\nSo, what other properties are we able to consider? To find them, it is useful to work the other way around from the usual explanatory story, starting with our target phenomenon: the observation of fractional quantum statistics. At this level we are hard pressed to find a more \"approximate\" characterization of the property, as this would either entail redefining what we mean with \"observing the phase\", which reeks of the \"ad-hoc\" kind of justification Shech is wary of, or finding a different explanation entirely. The latter is actually easier than it sounds, as the explanation given by Laughlin himself does not strictly rely on topological arguments, but on calculating the Berry connection of fractionally charged quasiholes encircling each other. I will evaluate whether this is a viable alternative later, but one obvious problem is that this explanation itself relies on a 2D idealization, which is the problem under consideration to begin with. This idealization might not be as problematic however. (this is later or earlier, haven't figured out where to put it)\n\n=garbo=\nNext, we have an equally unpromising candidate, which is the \"mini-explanation\". The fundamental group of 2D exchange under two particles is the Braid group\nE. The fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of $N$ identical particles in 2D is $B_N$\nL. The quantum statistics of a particle is the 1D rep of the fundamental group of the ...\nC. The quantum statistics of 2D particles are anyonic i.e. $e^{i\\theta}$\n(I'm being loose with the structure here, as otherwise it would be a huge drag to write everything out, i.e. \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group of the configuration space of the exchange of two identical particles is $e^{i\\theta}$\", \"The 1D rep of the fundamental group ... are the quantum statistics\", .... (secretly I don't really know how to write this out DN style as the example laws are always extremely simple conditionals, nor do I really know how to transfer this to theorems rather than laws. If this is a big problem we can discuss this, I think more likely I will have to get rid of the reference to the DN explanation or formulate this differently entirely. Regardless, this is more an example of how I wish to argue))\n=garbo=\n\n...\n\nThe most promising candidate for such an intervention is centered around the fundamental group of the system, but not in the way that the argument is presented by Shech. Instead let us examine how the argument goes once more:\n\nWe see the Quantum Hall Effect manifest\n\n** COMMENT Checklist\n\n To show it can be approximated, I need to show that there are /some/ paths which are nondeformable into one another/non collapsible to a point. In order to do that I need to let go of another idealization that is made which prevents that somehow. *I need to make plausible that some paths in 3+1D get intertwined!!*\n\n** Options\n\n*** Particles have nonzero size\n\nIn these examples, particles are usually treated as having no extension whatsoever. This is obviously unrealistic. If particles have some extension, however small, there is some leeway in having them have paths which are not able to be contracted to a point.\n\n*** Not ALL paths\n\nWhile the connectedness is described using ALL possible paths to describe the entire space, it seems possible that in some small section of the space things work differently. You can't continuously cut off the distance the path sees, except for keeping them within a spacelike distance. That's still more than enough paths tho.\n\n\n*** Winding can be something different?\nThe main thing I want to claim is that you can approximate some kind of winding without having to talk about 2d spaces, I just want to get there directly.\n\n#+transclude: t\n[[id:0bbb9ce7-191f-4fde-8924-cad8a3886e2e][Group]]\n\n\n\n\n** COMMENT Junk\n\n Startingfrom the position that the configuration space is 2D, and then all the other points deductively follow Looked at in this way I would agree with Shech: 3D cannot approximately be 2D space in the relevant sense, namely in the sense of the space being connected or not.\n\n However, what I argue is that this is /not/ the relevant factor/definition/whatchamaycallit to consider, or at the very least not the only one. While I agree the 3D space cannot approximate 2D space if the property under consideration is connectedness as presented, I do think it is possible for some other factor down the argumentative line to be considered \"approximately instantiated\" in the Nortonian sense.\n\n We just need to find a different path to \"fit in\" to the explanation of the possibility of anyons, i.e. either\n 1. 2D space is approximately instatiated in the experiment due to thinness and strong fields, giving rise to something with the same properties as 2D space\n 2. Holes are approximately instantiated, for instance ??\n 3. Connectedness is approximate, in the sense that we don't care about /all/ paths but just most paths, and we can create a lot of paths which don't work well\n 4. Homotopy classes are approximate, in the sense that we don't derive the homotopy classes from the connectedness of the space but from looking at different paths and seeing that they /don't/ act the same way. rather than that they /can't/ act the same way\n 5. Fundamental group is approximate, in the sense that we don't look at all the homotopy classes but look at what kind of behavior the elements of the group have\n 6. 1D rep is approximate. I don't see how this would work.\n 7. Equivalence between spin is approximate, in the sense that there is some other physical mechanism which causes the phase to be such which does not rely on the above, such as the Berry phase calculation.\n\n\n So, which of these is the most likely canditate for approximate instantiation?\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210611132541-isomporphism.org","oid":"78bfd4074abb8ca64c297c8d0ba2fc0637e875a2","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       b671608b-4efc-4c3a-afea-5e392abaa86c\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701195103\n:ctime:    20210611132541\n:"},{"count":34,"value":"END:\n#+title: Isomporphism\n#+filetags: definition mathematics\n\n* Isomporphism\n\nLike, equivalence, but mathematically.\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210706155905-dynamical_phase_factor.org","oid":"e374de948d2eb040d882281a393970a9d1547e87","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       d343ba0a-0f9d-40f1-9710-6a2724a85389\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210706155934\n:ctime:    20210706155905\n:"},{"count":36,"value":"END:\n#+title: Dynamical Phase factor\n#+filetags: phase quantum physics\n\n\\(e^{iEt/\\hbar}\\)\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"20210911173330-test_driven_writing.org","oid":"4aa3885c1fab1dc59094da54c214319db5b2e982","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       2d54ce7d-5106-4873-a439-5a50edff1156\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210911183407\n:ctime:    20210911173330\n:"},{"count":458,"value":"END:\n#+title: Test Driven Writing\n#+filetags: :writing:thesis:idea:\n\nI really like the idea of [[id:c25b8934-ddf3-47e1-b5ec-aa959858df2d][Test Driven Development]].\nOne of the reasons I usually struggle with writing is that it is hard to see whether I am making any progress, and whether what I am writing fulfills the \"requirements\" of what I want to do.

This mirrors the major issue with boundary drawing/discretization, namely that some boundary is drawn in order to facilitate reasoning about some object or concept, when identifying or justifying that boundary is difficult. The shared difficulty, then, consists in justifying either the use or reality of such simplifications.\n\nHowever, common descripitions/(word) of idealization specifically include the fact that they introduce a /false/ description, which is not something we ought to assume about the boundary drawing problem, as doing so would beg the question. Instead we will take the by now familiar stance of examining /how, if at all/ the use or legitimacy of idealizations is justified, and hopefully extrapolate from there.\n\n*** Characterizations of idealization?\n\nCharacterizations of idealizations are abound in the literature, although few dare claim to provide an exhaustive one. The most discussed are cite:Norton2012 's characterization of idealization as opposed to approximation:\n- Approximation: proposition which sort of describes the target\n- Idealization: model whose properties sort of describe the target\n\nNorton's standard example is a ball falling through the atmosphere. We have an excellent formula for calculating the velocity $v(t)$ starting at $v=t=0$ as\n\\[\nv(t)=\\frac{g}{k}(1-\\exp(-kt))=gt-\\frac{gkt^2}{2}+\\frac{gk^2t^3}{6}-\\ldots\n\\]\nwhere $g$ is the accelaration due to gravity, and $k$ a friction coefficient.\n\nAs any physics student knows, it is often convenient to leave out the influence of air resistance. Setting $k=0$ gives us\n\\[\nv(t)=gt\n\\]\n\nGiven Norton's distinction, we can look at the above formula in two ways, either as an approximation or as an idealization. If we view it as an approximation i.e. a proposition describing the actual system inexactly, we can say that this is a good approximation for the first part of the ball's descent, becoming a worse and worse approximation as the ball continues to fall. We could also view it as an idealization, in which case we view the above equation as representing a (false) model of a ball falling in a vacuum. It is not the description of this model that is false, rather the model (idealization) misrepresents our world in some way, namely by leaving out air.\n\nIn this example the differnce between an approximation and an idealization is simply a point of view: we can freely shift the characterization of the formula as an approximation or idealization. The \"shifting\" Norton calls promotion and demotion respectively. Promotion consists in taking the approximation to describe a new, idealized model, while demotion is extracting one or more inexact propositions from an existing idealization.  I mention this now because it will come in handy later.\n\nOther descriptions are due to cite:Strevens2007, which characterizes idealizations more similarly to how I did above, as deliberate falsifications of reality. Specifically, Strevens conceptualizes idealizations in terms of the operation behind them: setting a parameter to zero, infinity, or some other number.\n\n*** Why do we not consider the target system an idealization? It's also a model\n\n*** Is idealization different than abstraction?\n\n** Not focus on idealizations as a whole but on infinite idealizations\n\nAs is tradition by now, I wish to focus on a subsection of idealizations first in order to get a better grasp on them. Idealization as construed above does not differ that much from a model, indeed Norton even seems to treat them as synonyms. Analyzing models on their own is difficult, and since idealizations are difficult to distinguish from models entirely, analyizing idealizations on their own will in all likelihood also turn out to be difficult. Therefore let us turn to a more problematic example of idealization, one which has more easily identifiable examples: infinite idealizations.\n\nInfinite idealizations (also called \"asymptotic idealizations\" by for instance cite:Strevens2019 or \"asymptotic explanation\" by for instance cite:Batterman2005) are, put crudely, an idealization which is arrived at through some sort of limiting operation, through which a parameter of the original model is made to approach infinity[fn:infinitesimal]. Commonly discussed examples in the literature are the thermodynamic limit (TDL), the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), the Aharanov Bohm effect, infinite population models ....\n\nAs promised, infinite idealizations run into more obvious problems more quickly: in the thermodynamic limit the number of particles goes to infinity, the FQHE posits 2D particles, the AB effect requires an infinitely long solenoid and in order to explain gene distribuitions biologists assume infinite populations. /Prima facie/, the problem appears straightforward: such things do not exist. \"Can you show me an infinitely long solenoid?\", the detractor exclaims. However, why does this appear so problematic? After all, was intentional misrepresentation not the characterizing feature of idealizations? Why is setting air resistance to $0$ less problematic than setting the $z$-axis to $0$?\n\n...\n\n** Characterizations of infinite idealizations\n (This is the important part, where everything before this is more an idea of how I would fit it in the rest of my thesis)\n*** Norton\n\nFirst in cite:Norton2012 and more in depth in cite:Norton2014, Norton describes his unease with so called \"infinite idealizations\". Although never providing a strict definition, we can make an educated guess to one:\n\n*Infinite Idealization (Norton):*\n\nAn infinite idealization is made by performing a limiting operation on an idealized system, taking some parameter (such as length, number, volume) to either zero or infinity. The infinite idealization is the system with the parameter /set/ to zero or infinity. However, sometimes these systems misbehave by either the limit not obtaining or conflicting, which is bad.\n\nThis characterization somewhat goes against the limit of what Norton intends to argue, namely that such infinite idealizations are not idealizations at all, but can only be sensibly understood as /approximations/ as defined above. For \"the essential starting point of the notion of idealization is that we have a consistently describably system, even if it is fictitious.\"cite:Norton2014 pp. 200   However, I am not willing to grant that condition just yet, so for now we will refer to these systems as infinite idealizations.\n\nNorton furthermore distinguishes between well-behaved and ill-behaved idealizations.[fn:well-behaved] Ill-behaved idealizations are infinite idealizations whose limit system (the system with the parameter /set/ to zero or infinity) does not match with target system in some way. This mismatch can take two forms cite:Norton2012 (3.2, 3.3): the limit system might not exist, e.g. an infinite sphere, or the limit system might have a property which conflicts with a property of the target system. For the former, if we define a sphere as all points which are equidistant from some other point, then an infinite sphere does not exist, as there are no points at infinity. ($\\mathbb{R}=(-\\infty, \\infty)$ not tt$[-\\infty,\\infty]$) For the latter, Norton imagines modelling an arbitarily long ellipsoid as an infinite cylinder. While they look similar, the ratio of surface to volume for an ellipsoid is different than that for a cylinder, so the idealization has a fundamental mismatch.\n\nIn short: for Norton infinite idealization simply is the end result of the process of a limiting operation. Furthermore, these idealizations can sometimes be well behaved, and sometimes ill-behaved.\n\n*** Strevens\n\ncite:Strevens2019a defines infinity (or \"asymptotic\" as he likes to call it, we will stick with infinite here) idealizations slightly differently than Norton. Luckily, Strevens does provide a clear definition, which is in contrast to what he calls a \"simple\" idealization, which \"is ahieved by the straightforward operation of setting some parameter or parameters in the model to non-actual values, often zero\". A clear example is the air-resistance coeffient above. At first, he constrast this straightforwardly with infinite idealizations in the Norton sense, as \"in asymptotic idealization, by contrast, a fiction is introduced by taking some sort of limit\". This definition can be taken to be identical with Norton's.\n\nHowever, later on in the paper he adds an additional layer to the definition, (TODO find a good quote for this) namely that infinite idealizations are made when it is not possible to use a simple idealization to directly the relevant property to zero (or infinity). Furthermore, he adds, \"Asymptotic idealization is an interesting proposition, then, only in those cases where a simple substitution cannot be performed, which is to say only in those cases where a veridical model for mathematical reasons falls apart or otherwise behaves badly at the limiting value.\" While Strevens later argues why these interesting cases (Norton's mismatches) /do/ make sense, we do not have to concern us with evaluating that just yet, we simply need to note that Strevens makes the same distinction as Norton here. Then, we can define\n\n*Infinite Idealization (Strevens):*\n\nAn infinite idealization is made by performing a limiting operation on a system, taking some \"extrapolation\" parameter (such as length, number, volume) to either zero or infinity *in order to set some other parameter to zero or infinity.* The infinite idealization is the system with the extrapolation parameter and the relevant paramenter set to either zero or infinity (dont' need to be the same). However, sometimes these systems misbehave, *which is interesting*.\n(bold to highlight differences with Norton)\n\nBatterman also has some definition but it is rather vague.\n\n** Why this is confusing\n\nI am not satisfied with definitions, as they contain too many different relevant pieces of information such as whether they misbehave, how they do the operation and what kind of subset they form of idealizations in general. I believe that the discussion of infinite idealization would be much clearer if we distinguished between the factors that contribute to the problem, as follows.\n\n** A Categorization of Idealization\n\nFocusing on the discussion of infinite idealizations solely, I believe 4 (maybe 5) distinctions can be drawn. I will first present the distinctions, and then show how I believe they are ordered. The goal is to create categories for (infinite) idealizations to facilitate reasoning and argument, since, as we have seen above, Norton and Strevens are not per se arguing over the same definition, even if it is close.\n\n*** Simple vs. Infinite Idealizations\n\nIn Strevens and less explicitly in Norton, the discussion is presented as being about this distinction, but actually concerns a subclass of infinite idealizations we shall discuss below. However, the simple vs. infinite distinction is a useful one, but I will draw it differently than Strevens.\na) /Simple Idealization/.\n    A simple idealization is an idealization in which no limit is taken in order to set the relevant parameter.\nb) /Infinite Idealization/.\n   An infinite idealization is one in which a limit is taken in order to set a parameter.\n\nNote that no reference has been made to whether or not it affects another parameter, or whether the limit operation is succesful. I argue that this is first and foremost the distinction between these idealizations, and that other qualities should be discussed separately. (I am not sure whether idealizations can be split up neatly into two disjoint sets like these (I'm not sure if that can be done at all, see cite:WEBER2010 ), but i'll just treat it like it does)\n\nThis is a distinction based on /method/: /how/ is the idealization achieved? The idealized system might end up the same in some cases, but the operation is the relevant piece.\n\n*** Direct vs. Indirect Idealizations\n\nThis distinction is also due to Strevens, although he does not discuss it separately and makes it co-refering(?) with the first distinction. Direct idealizations, as the name implies, directly alter the relevant parameter e.g. setting air resitance to zero in order to have zero air resistance.  Indirect idealizations on the other hand, alter a parameter in order to alter the actually relevant parameter, e.g. infinite population in order to set genetic drift to zero, or infinite particles in order to achieve a singularity.\n\nThis is a distinction based on /goal/: /what/ should the idealization achieve? Indirect idealizations are sometimes necessary in order to get rid of a pesky parameter. Note that while this is an intention based distinction, in some models the same parameter might be set directly or indirectly. While in Newtonian Mechanics we might set the air resistance to zero directly, in a more complete QFT description of the same situation we have no access to such a parameter.\n\nAlso note that this distinction is not the same as the one between infinite and simple idealizations: as Strevens notes, it is completely in the realm of possibility to directly set a parameter to zero using an infinite limiting operation, \"but you would merely be showing off.\"\n\nAdditionally, only infinite ideazations can be indirect, but not all are.\n\n*** Unproblematic/boring vs. problematic/interesting\n\n(not sure what to call this yet, should be catchy)\nThis distinction is both due to Strevens and Norton, and is what I believe the main distinction we ought to discuss. This distinction is only relevant for *indirect infinite* idealizations, as both Norton and Strevens agree that all direct and simple idealizations provide little puzzlement. Indirect infinite idealizations can be boring i.e. there is no mismatch with the idealized system and the target system (I have no example), or interesting, by creating such a mismatch. All the idealizations under discussion fall under this category.\n\nThis is a distinction based on /result/: /what/ is the idealization like? (Not too sure about this characterization, not very catchy)\n\n*** Absent vs. Contradictory\n\n(also unsure about these names) (other idea self-contradictory and \"external\"-contradictory? extracontradictory?)\nThis distinction is due to Norton, as Strevens does not explicitly distinguish between the two. This distinction only concerns *interesting idealizations*. For absent idealizations, the idealized model system simply cannot exist in its own terms: an infinite sphere does not denote anything. Contradictory idealizations, on the other hand, postulate some property of the model system which conficts with another property we hold to be incontrovertible, or at least uncontroversial. Most of the idealizations under discussion fall under this category: infinite populations are not self contradictory, but they prevent probabilistic reasoning using uniform distributions.\n\nThis is a distinction based on ???\n\n*** Putative distinctions\n\nThere are two more distinctions of which I am not sure I can genuinely draw them.\n\n**** Quantitative vs qualitative mismatch/contradiction.\n- Quantitative\n  Here I mean Norton's ellipsoid elongating to a cylinder: the mismatch comes from the ellipsoid having a certain volume/surface ratio in all finite stages, but a different one when infinitely long. No property is set to zero or infinity, unless you count \"cylinderness\".\n- Qualitative\n  Some property becomes true or false in the infinite limit which is not false or true in the finite case. Most of the actual examples are here: having or not having phase transitions, being 2D or 3D, exhibiting or not exhibiting an effect\n\n  The reason I doubt this distinction is because I feel like it's a question of framing. A very important question, which I should investigate, but not a distinction of kind per se.\n\n**** Logical/transcendental contradiction vs a physical/intuitive contradiction.\n\nThe former is exemplified by Streven's infinite population example: the main problem is that for an infinite population it is no longer possible to have countable additivity with a uniform distribution, and so you cannot use the Strong Law of Large Numbers and could not say anything about the probability of genetic drift (might be badly paraphrasing): the method itself is no longer useful, but it's not a direct self-contradiction as the infinite sphere, as an infinite population is a sensible concept. The latter is a bit more vague, but here I mean e.g. the thermodynamic limit: it does not work because it stipulates an inifite number of particles. However, this is in conflict with the whole idea that the world is made up of molecules. BUT not directly so, as cite:Shech2013 points out, it is only a real paradox if we stipulate that statistical mechanics in the thermodynamic limit is a true/accurate representaiton of the world, which we need to justify by e.g. (or i.e.? I don't know of any others) an indispensability argument.\n\nThis is a distinction based on????\n\nI doubt this because the former category might refer to the same as \"absent\" idealizations.\n\n** Order of the distinctions\n\nI think the order is best explained by this beautiful diagram, the whole box being \"idealization-space\". Not included is how this is linked to approximations, nor the distinctions I am unsure about, this is simply to show how the above distinctions work:\n\n[[../HPS/Thesis/Beautiful_Images/idealization_distinctions.png]]\n\n** Discussion\n\n\nWhile these distinctions might appear nitpicky, I think they are vital for making sure we are discussing the correct problem. Additionally, in making these distinctions it became clear that perhaps more distinctions need to be made, such as the specific nature of the contradiction induced, see Section \\ref{sec:orgff730de}.\n\nWhat is clear is how infinite idealizations (the interesting ones at least) differ from idealizations in general or simple ones. Infinite idealizations are a subcategory of idealizations, together with simple idealizations (whether they completely fill the category of idealization is left open). However, the distinction between infinite idealizations and simple idealizations does not prove particularly enlightening. Other distinctions will be more fruitful to investigate. I do not think this warrants a change in nomenclature per se, as there is substantial literature on infinite idealizations already. Clarification would be in order though.\n\n\n* Bib\n\\printbibliography\n* Footnotes\n\n[fn:well-behaved] Again, Norton actually does not consider ill-behaved idealizations to be idealizations at all, but for now we shall simply pretend he does in order to compare his stance.\n\n\n[fn:infinitesimal]  (or zero, in case of infinitesimal idealizations. While there might be some differences between the two, for now I will assume they behave the same.)\n\n"}],"additions":9,"deletions":0},{"filepath":"invariance.org","oid":"4e23888f169f175238e20f8cd10900fa6829c68a","diff":[{"count":19,"value":":PROPERTIES:\n:ID:       63222d96-8674-4461-8ca8-fa3e94bfcfad\n:"},{"count":12,"added":true,"value":"mtime:    20210701194934\n:ctime:    20210701194934\n:"},{"count":80,"value":"END:\n#+title: Invariance\n#+filetags: mathematics physics definition\n\n* Invariance\n\n*Invariance* is the generic property of being unchanging under some transformation.

It just says that you have stuff, you reason, and you have a conclusion.\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/It seems plausible to endorse a view according to which the particularity of the scenarios involved in thought-experimental reasoning supplies some epistemic force, while also accepting that the regularities to which scientific thought-experimental reasoning gives us access are contingent features of the natural world/\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1156) How does thinking that \"the particularity of the scenarios involved supplies some epistemic force\" lead to siding with Brown? Is it because Norton claims that the conclusion of your thought experiment should be the same as long as it's \"an argument\"? Rather than the particular setting of the thought experiment aloowing us some priviliged epistemic access to... something?\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/We feel little hesitation in saying that you now know that four elephants wouldn’t fit comfortably in your neighbor’s living room, whereas you didn’t know it before/\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1157)\nGood example, because usually when we talk about \"knowledge\" it is about things we know directly and all we can infer from it.\n\nIf you here hooves in the distance, you don't /know/ whether it's zebras or horses.\n\nAre there cases similar to this, where you don't know something, you think for a bit, and then you know? The obvious example is math, but this sounds like points for Norton if anything.\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/Four elephants, mentally arrayed them in the room, and tried to ascertain whether there was space for the four elephants within the confines of the room’s four walls. Of course, in many ways, the mental image you formed was unspecified:/\n#+end_quote\n\n(Gendler, 2004, p. 1157)\nI think aphantasia is a good counter argument to this: surely people without this abilitiy could still do thought experiments? Just simple \"what if\" things could still work.\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/you presumably invoked a mental image of the room (using memory), and—holding constant your affordance-based sense of its dimensions—evoked a quasiproprioceptive image of the experience of riding a bicycle in a space/\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1157) Let us do a thought experiment ourselves of someone without this ability: this person could still perform this thought experiment if they made an estimate of how large the room was, how large an average elephant is, and do more of a Fermi-estimate of whether it is possible to ride an elephant there.\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/But is that really what happened? My inclination is to think not. Rather, what happened is that formed a judgment on the basis of your manipulation of your mental image, and—using that new information—went on to draw your conclusion about the more general statement for which you took it to be evidence./\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1158) I think it really depends on the person's mental faculties (that sounds mean) whether that is plausible or not.\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/wouldn’t you proceed by putting the elephants into the room, and seeing whether they fit? Suppose I took away the third and fourth elephants before you managed to place them in the room. Would your imaginary continuation of the process you had begun really be a process of deductive reasoning?/\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1158) Okay good point, I also doubt that someone would not be able to continue that, butttt maybe they did? The question of whether this \"putting things in a thing and see if it fits\" is \"deductive reasoning\" is interesting though, but I don't see how those are per se incompatible. Although, yes, you're not really deductively reasoning, even though it could be modeled as such.\n\n\n(Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) \\\\\nIs the \"elephant\" example even a good thought experiment, comparable with Galileo's balls? One difference is that the new knowledge in this case is very similar to knowledge we already have: the question is not whether big things can sometimes fit into smaller things, but whether the things are bigger than the other. GBalls was about whether heavy things fall faster than slow things /in general/. Maybe a comparable thing would be the standard math problem of a train traveling by x km/s vs a train traveling by y km/s: which arrives earlier? Sure, given vague data (elephants, room) we need to do some more work to get to the conclusion, but it's not really /interesting/ because we could have easily figured it out with more data.\n\nOf course, galileo could have just dropped some balls, but he did have some actual constraints (such as air resistance) and his conclusion is much more general.\n\n\n(Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) Maybe the conclusion is: thought experiments are different things for different people? That is a bit boring.\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/Research by Roger Shepard and others has shown that judgments about topological similarity are generally made after engaging in the mental manipulation of an image: the greater the degree of rotation required to project one onto the other, the longer it takes to judge whether two figures are isomorphic/\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1159) \\\\\nInteresting example about intuitive reasoning, but are they really /thought experiments?/ Or, to play nicely, should this be counted as performing a thought experiment? By their criteria it does, but maybe their criteria are not stringent enough?\n\nOne possible criteria: a thought experiment is an experiment you either cannot do or cannot generalize when done physically.\n\nThen the topological similarity does sort of count, but I kind of struggle with congrueing mathematics and \"experimenting\" lol\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/do we really want to say that the belief was formed by deductive or inductive reasoning/\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1160) Is imagining a scenario and then forming a belief from it really a thought experiment? I find this idea a bit too general, but don't have a convincing enough argument against it.\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/As before, it’s hard to see why we would want to say that this new justified true belief (that the rotated image resembles Texas) was formed by inductive or deductive reasoning from known premises./\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1161) Decent point. The answer to \"How do you infer that this image is Texas?\" is not a step by step process. BUT: this is more saying something about \"perception\" than how a thought experiment works. I guess the one thing you can say is that the setup of~ a thought experiment (if you could call this one) does have a lot of impact on the conclusions we draw from it.\n\n\n#+begin_quote\n/This belief is produced not inferentially, but quasi-observationally: the presence of the mental image plays a crucial cognitive role in its formation./\n#+end_quote\n\n (Gendler, 2004, p. 1162) I think this point is really hard to disagree with: the imaginative component is very powerful, and what we are doing when we perform a thought experiment is much more akin to \"intuiting\" than \"deducing\".},\n","added":true,"removed":false}],"additions":1593,"deletions":0}],"additions":2208,"deletions":0},{"oid":"436fc50118ee5296a3721580da80cd55b12844fb","message":"Initial commit\n","date":1636033894,"files":[{"filepath":".gitignore","oid":"859f705bdb6ee2bbbbb24fc91a065ddbbe77666e","diff":[{"count":157,"value":"## Core latex/pdflatex auxiliary files:\n*.aux\n*.lof\n*.log\n*.lot\n*.fls\n*.out\n*.toc\n*.fmt\n*.fot\n*.cb\n*.cb2\n.*.lb\n\n## Intermediate documents:\n*.dvi\n*.xdv\n*-converted-to.*\n# these rules might exclude image files for figures etc.\n# *.ps\n# *.eps\n# *.pdf\n\n## Generated if empty string is given at \"Please type another file name for output:\"\n.pdf\n\n## Bibliography auxiliary files (bibtex/biblatex/biber):\n*.bbl\n*.bcf\n*.blg\n*-blx.aux\n*-blx.bib\n*.run.xml\n\n## Build tool auxiliary files:\n*.fdb_latexmk\n*.synctex\n*.synctex(busy)\n*.synctex.gz\n*.synctex.gz(busy)\n*.pdfsync\n\n## Build tool directories for auxiliary files\n# latexrun\nlatex.out/\n\n## Auxiliary and intermediate files from other packages:\n# algorithms\n*.alg\n*.loa\n\n# achemso\nacs-*.bib\n\n# amsthm\n*.thm\n\n# beamer\n*.nav\n*.pre\n*.snm\n*.vrb\n\n# changes\n*.soc\n\n# comment\n*.cut\n\n# cprotect\n*.cpt\n\n# elsarticle (documentclass of Elsevier journals)\n*.spl\n\n# endnotes\n*.ent\n\n# fixme\n*.lox\n\n# feynmf/feynmp\n*.mf\n*.mp\n*.t[1-9]\n*.t[1-9][0-9]\n*.tfm\n\n#(r)(e)ledmac/(r)(e)ledpar\n*.end\n*.?end\n*.[1-9]\n*.[1-9][0-9]\n*.[1-9][0-9][0-9]\n*.[1-9]R\n*.[1-9][0-9]R\n*.[1-9][0-9][0-9]R\n*.eledsec[1-9]\n*.eledsec[1-9]R\n*.eledsec[1-9][0-9]\n*.eledsec[1-9][0-9]R\n*.eledsec[1-9][0-9][0-9]\n*.eledsec[1-9][0-9][0-9]R\n\n# glossaries\n*.acn\n*.acr\n*.glg\n*.glo\n*.gls\n*.glsdefs\n*.lzo\n*.lzs\n\n# uncomment this for glossaries-extra (will ignore makeindex's style files!)\n# *.ist\n\n# gnuplottex\n*-gnuplottex-*\n\n# gregoriotex\n*.gaux\n*.gtex\n\n# htlatex\n*.4ct\n*.4tc\n*.idv\n*.lg\n*.trc\n*.xref\n\n# hyperref\n*.brf\n\n# knitr\n*-concordance.tex\n# TODO Comment the next line if you want to keep your tikz graphics files\n*.tikz\n*-tikzDictionary\n\n# listings\n*.lol\n\n# luatexja-ruby\n*.ltjruby\n\n# makeidx\n*.idx\n*.ilg\n*.ind\n\n# minitoc\n*.maf\n*.mlf\n*.mlt\n*.mtc[0-9]*\n*.slf[0-9]*\n*.slt[0-9]*\n*.stc[0-9]*\n\n# minted\n_minted*\n*.pyg\n\n# morewrites\n*.mw\n\n# nomencl\n*.nlg\n*.nlo\n*.nls\n\n# pax\n*.pax\n\n# pdfpcnotes\n*.pdfpc\n\n# sagetex\n*.sagetex.sage\n*.sagetex.py\n*.sagetex.scmd\n\n# scrwfile\n*.wrt\n\n# sympy\n*.sout\n*.sympy\nsympy-plots-for-*.tex/\n\n# pdfcomment\n*.upa\n*.upb\n\n# pythontex\n*.pytxcode\npythontex-files-*/\n\n# tcolorbox\n*.listing\n\n# thmtools\n*.loe\n\n# TikZ & PGF\n*.dpth\n*.md5\n*.auxlock\n\n# todonotes\n*.tdo\n\n# vhistory\n*.hst\n*.ver\n\n# easy-todo\n*.lod\n\n# xcolor\n*.xcp\n\n# xmpincl\n*.xmpi\n\n# xindy\n*.xdy\n\n# xypic precompiled matrices and outlines\n*.xyc\n*.xyd\n\n# endfloat\n*.ttt\n*.fff\n\n# Latexian\nTSWLatexianTemp*\n\n## Editors:\n# WinEdt\n*.bak\n*.sav\n\n# Texpad\n.texpadtmp\n\n# LyX\n*.lyx~\n\n# Kile\n*.backup\n\n# gummi\n.*.swp\n\n# KBibTeX\n*~[0-9]*\n\n# TeXnicCenter\n*.tps\n\n# auto folder when using emacs and auctex\n./auto/*\n*.el\n\n# expex forward references with \\gathertags\n*-tags.tex\n\n# standalone packages\n*.sta\n\n# Makeindex log files\n*.lpz\n","added":true,"removed":false}],"additions":157,"deletions":0}],"additions":157,"deletions":0},{"oid":"e99815e419c1b365a21c202d09531db05202cb98","message":"meta: add CC license\n","date":1636034113,"files":[{"filepath":"LICENSE.md","oid":"d379d94d3be5b570a8281e446f712bec87746464","diff":[{"count":2906,"value":"# Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International\n\nCreative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not provide legal services or legal advice.

The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n* __Considerations for licensors:__ Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. [More considerations for licensors](http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors_and_licensees#Considerations_for_licensors).\n\n* __Considerations for the public:__ By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n### Section 1 – Definitions.\n\na. __Adapted Material__ means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\nb. __Adapter's License__ means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nc. __BY-NC-SA Compatible License__ means a license listed at [creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses](http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses), approved by Creative Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n\nd. __Copyright and Similar Rights__ means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\ne. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n\nf. __Exceptions and Limitations__ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\ng. __License Elements__ means the license attributes listed in the name of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this Public License are Attribution, NonCommercial, and ShareAlike.\n\nh. __Licensed Material__ means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n\ni. __Licensed Rights__ means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\nj. __Licensor__ means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n\nk. __NonCommercial__ means not primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for other material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights by digital file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the exchange.\n\nl. __Share__ means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n\nm. __Sui Generis Database Rights__ means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\nn. __You__ means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. __Your__ has a corresponding meaning.\n\n### Section 2 – Scope.\n\na. ___License grant.___\n\n   1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and\n\n        B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.\n\n   2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n\n   3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n\n   4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n   5. __Downstream recipients.__\n\n        A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n        B. __Additional offer from the Licensor – Adapted Material.__ Every recipient of Adapted Material from You automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material under the conditions of the Adapter’s License You apply.\n\n        C. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n\n   6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\nb. ___Other rights.___\n\n   1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n   2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n\n   3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial purposes.\n\n### Section 3 – License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n\na. ___Attribution.___\n\n   1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n       A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n\n         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n\n         ii. a copyright notice;\n\n         iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n         iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n\n       B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n       C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n   2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n\n   3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\nb. ___ShareAlike.___\n\nIn addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n1. The Adapter’s License You apply must be a Creative Commons license with the same License Elements, this version or later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\n\n2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\na. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes only;\n\nb. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\nc. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\na. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__\n\nb. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.__\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n### Section 6 – Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n   1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n   2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n### Section 8 – Interpretation.\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n> Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.
