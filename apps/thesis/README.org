* Thesis

This is a website which serves as
a) a visualization of my thesis, allowing for more interactive elements than a static pdf would, and
b) a way for my supervisors to gain insight into my work
c) a way for me to be lazy and not have to email people changes
  but most importantly
d) a way to motivate me to actually work on my thesis by making my progress extremely transparent.
