That might mean providing all the necessary background to understand some (boring to you) idea, or self-censoring, or adding lots of qualifiers, or spending lots of effort on clarity. Many of these practices can be somewhat useful as part of your own thinking process—for instance, clearer writing usually involves clearer thinking. But I find it substantially increases the overhead and effort in writing, often to the point of producing blockage.\n\nMore concretely, this manifests as a common failure mode for me when I’m writing notes as part of explicit preparation for some public writing. I’ll often try to do both jobs at once. That is, I might be writing atomic-style notes ([[z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1:::Evergreen notes should be atomic]]) but I try to write them *as if* they’re sections in a larger essay or work. Or even just: I try to write things with all the context and clear prose needed for an outsider to understand what I’m talking about. Then I often find that I can’t write anything at all! Better to write at a level where I can produce something, then use that to lever myself upward. ([[z6C5H4eYH2A4omfNLuUcDiKibQ1hZG2RGNZ97:::Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)]])\n\nWhen it’s a topic I understand well, I can write notes for both myself and an audience simultaneously. But that sometimes produces the false impression that I can pull this off all the time! To avoid that false impression, I’ll write notes for myself “by default,” and only “opt into” writing notes for an audience explicitly.\n\n---\n\nQ. What bad habit do I often fall into when writing evergreen notes in preparation for public writing?\nA. I’ll try to do my public writing as part of my first pass on the notes.\n\nQ. Why do I often find myself stuck when I try to write evergreen notes as publishable prose for an audience?\nA. When a topic is hard enough to distill on its own, the extra cognitive load of considering a reader overwhelms me.\n\n\n\n\n",

            "contentMarkdown": "# Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented\n\nIt’s best to factor [[z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C:::Evergreen notes]] by concept (rather than by author, book, event, project, topic, etc). This way, you discover connections across books and domains as you update and link to the note over time ([[z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC:::Evergreen notes should be densely linked]]).\n\nThe most straightforward way to take notes is to start a new note for each book, each project, or each research topic. Because each note covers many concepts, it can be hard to find what you’ve written when a concept comes up again later: you have to remember the name of each book or project which dealt with the topic (by contrast: [[z4Rrmh17vMBbauEGnFPTZSK3UmdsGExLRfZz1:::Evergreen notes should be atomic]]).\n\nWhen you read another book which discusses the same concept, you’ll write a new note on that book. With this approach, there’s no accumulation (contra [[z6UDDkom8Aifg6mLdjT1sPtbMBweCmpyTwmJT:::Knowledge work should accrete]]). Your new thoughts on the concept don’t combine with the old ones to form a stronger whole: you just have a scattered set of notes on the concept, perhaps referring to it by different names, each embedded in some larger document.\n\nIt’s not just about accumulation. There’s also no pressure to synthesize your new ideas on the concept with your prior thoughts about it. Is there tension between them? Is some powerful distillation only visible when all these ideas are considered simultaneously? [[zX1WtJ4ouE8sjN1NgWHsGVg8ZnVfp5Kz74Vs:::Understanding requires effortful engagement]]\n\nIf we read two books about exactly the same topic, we might easily link our notes about those two together. But novel connections tend to appear where they’re not quite so expected. When arranging notes by concept, you may make surprising links between ideas that came up in very different books. You might never have noticed that those books were related before—and indeed, they might not have been, except for this one point.\n\nOrganizing by concept makes note-taking a little harder, but in a useful way: when writing new notes, we have to find where they fit into the whole. So we explore some part of our prior web of notes, which may lead us somewhere unexpected.\n\nOver time, we accumulate notes which we can combine in increasingly complex ways ([[z3XP5GRmd9z1D2qCE7pxUvbeSVeQuMiqz9x1C:::Evergreen note titles are like APIs]]) to produce novel insights ([[z6cFzJWgj9vZpnrQsjrZ8yCNREzCTgyFeVZTb:::Evergreen note-writing helps insight accumulate]]).\n\n---\n\n## References\n\n[Extend Your Mind and Memory With a Zettelkasten • Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/extend-your-mind-and-memory-with-a-zettelkasten)\n\n\u003e When you’ve taken two texts apart already, a Zettelkasten will help you draw connections between them, see their similarities and oppositions.

(2017). *How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers*.\n\n\u003e In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?\n\n\u003e Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help you in the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument.\n\n\u003e Many students and academic writers think like the early ship owners when it comes to note-taking.

            "contentMarkdown": "# How to Take Smart Notes - Ahrens\n\nAhrens, S. (2017). *How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers*.\n\nA core book on [[zhmLXArqiCMDr9Q13ViqN3hh3SmrKzjQxWAr:::§Note-writing systems]] practice. Sönke focuses largely on the benefits of a Zettelkasten for the academic writing process. One of the core ideas here is that creative writing can become relatively closed-form and actionable; it can be made executable, GTD-style, through a series of steps drawing on a densely-connected note system.\n\n---\n\n## Advice on associations\n\nKeywords should be sparse and tightly curated. They’re meant mostly as a “jumping-off” point: the connections between notes will be the primary navigational device. [[z6ztEgzqZichYTJgabhYQLn4UY4FbC1JMH394:::Indexed references vs. tags]] [[z3MzhvmesiD2htMaEFQJif7gJgyaHAQvKH49Z:::Tags are an ineffective association structure]]\n\t\\- c) Making sure you will be able to find this note later by either linking to it from your index or by making a link to it on a note that you use as an entry point to a discussion or topic and is itself linked to the index.\n\t\\- In the Zettelkasten, keywords can easily be added to a note like tags and will then show up in the index. They should be chosen carefully and sparsely. Luhmann would add the number of one or two (rarely more) notes next to a keyword in the index (Schmidt 2013, 171).\n\t\\- Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note.\n\t\\- The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.\n\nWe should beware automatic linkages. [[z4RjXweCWNTdmHUFJpDCPmWVnwBEDbKviu9QJ:::Prefer explicit associations to inferred associations]]\n\t\\- Even though the Zettelkasten makes suggestions here, too, for example based on joint literature references, making good cross-references is a matter of serious thinking and a crucial part of the development of thoughts.\n\n## Advice on structuring the note archive\n\nIn the future, you’re likely to be thinking about “the impact of X on Y,” not a specific book which had a point about that topic. By using [[z6bci25mVUBNFdVWSrQNKr6u7AZ1jFzfTVbMF:::Evergreen notes should be concept-oriented]], you can build an organizational structure which reflects the future contexts in which you’d likely want to see the ideas you’ve distilled.\n\t\\- Many students and academic writers think like the early ship owners when it comes to note-taking. They handle their ideas and findings in the way it makes immediate sense: If they read an interesting sentence, they underline it. If they have a comment to make, they write it into the margins. If they have an idea, they write it into their notebook, and if an article seems important enough, they make the effort and write an excerpt. Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places. Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where and when these notes were written down. A text must then be conceptualised independently from these notes, which explains why so many resort to brainstorming to arrange the resources afterwards according to this preconceived idea.\n\t\\- In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?\n\t\\- Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help you in the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument.\n\nThe important thing about project notes seems to be that they be separated from the durable notes.\n\t\\- Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.\n\nNo need to treat every subject exhaustively: just write down what seems likely to help you think about the topics you’re pondering.\n\t\\- Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopaedia, but a tool to think with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. We don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence. We only write if it helps us with our own thinking.\n\n## Relative to memory systems\n\nFlashcards need to be elaborated and embedded in a context.\n\t\\- The information on flashcards is neither elaborated on nor embedded in some form of context. Each flashcard stays isolated instead of being connected with the network of theoretical frames, our experiences or our latticework of mental models.\n\n[[z6yfTwYekzvBkVjeH7WBUrSAJhyGTMYDAyYW7:::Evergreen note maintenance approximates spaced repetition]], but in a more natural context.\n\t\\- We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval). The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it.\n\nLimitations of memory\n\t\\- “Selection is the very keel on which our mental ship is built. And in this case of memory its utility is obvious. If we remembered everything, we should on most occasions be as ill off as if we remembered nothing. It would take as long for us to recall a space of time as it took the original time to elapse, and we should never get ahead with our thinking.” (William James 1890, 680).\n\n## Notes help you think accurately\n\nWriting while we read is a great way to monitor understanding: it’s hard to summarize something you don’t understand. The additional step of making associations and integrating that writing with prior notes makes this effect even more powerful. [[z8q1K5a8i95qARkpFwS45qqtQzM8th82TkeUg:::Writing forces sharper understanding]]\n\t\\- If we try to fool ourselves here and write down incomprehensible words, we will detect it in the next step when we try to turn our literature notes into permanent notes and try to connect them with others.\n\t\\- Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to … ? What is the difference between … ? What is it similar to?\n\n[[z4enRPbLXdD8X8hCfVjaRkcGkronvhcfrgSQw:::Do your own thinking]]\n\t\\- described in his famous text about the Enlightenment: “Nonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” (Kant 1784)\n\t\\- But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?\n\n Zettelkasten is more epistemologically honest, likely to find contrarian truths [[z8RTzukqNLKFXzqLwx25HrUrg5E5jiziGznWB:::Evergreen notes are a safe place to develop wild ideas]] [[z8q1K5a8i95qARkpFwS45qqtQzM8th82TkeUg:::Writing forces sharper understanding]]\n\t\\- Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight.\n\nIt’s hard to see what’s *not* said in a text. By integrating our reading observations with prior notes, we’re naturally confronted with rocks the author may have left unturned. [[z8q1K5a8i95qARkpFwS45qqtQzM8th82TkeUg:::Writing forces sharper understanding]]\n\t\\- Experienced academic readers usually read a text with questions in mind and try to relate it to other possible approaches, while inexperienced readers tend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take it as a given. What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.\n\n## People inappropriately ignore note-taking\n\nMost people are bad at writing notes, and they don’t know it, because the feedback is indirect and delayed. [[z8V2q398qu89vdJ73N2BEYCgevMqux3yxQUAC:::Note-writing practices are generally ineffective]]\n\t\\- There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.\n\nWriting notes feels like a huge time imposition, but that’s in comparison to an imaginary baseline: reading *without* writing notes is often *all* lost time. [[z6M8kex6kDF2FT6MWqAMDQddsqUr8sphLmyy1:::Evergreen note-writing helps reading efforts accumulate]]\n\t\\- And while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as ineffectual.\n\n## Notes help make creative insights happen\n\nPeople fixate on writing books and papers, but those things don’t emerge fully formed: they’re the synthesis of lots of detailed thinking on those topics. \n\t\\- focus lies almost always on the few exceptional moments where we write a lengthy piece, a book, an article or, as students, the essays and theses we have to hand in.\n\t\\- Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. Basically, that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle (Gadamer 2004).\n\nBrainstorming is a crutch…\n\t\\- As proper note-taking is rarely taught or discussed, it is no wonder that almost every guide on writing recommends to start with brainstorming. If you haven’t written along the way, the brain is indeed the only place to turn to. On its own, it is not such a great choice: it is neither objective nor reliable – two quite important aspects in academic or nonfiction writing. The promotion of brainstorming as a starting point is all the more surprising as it is not the origin of most ideas: The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. Rather, they come from the outside: through\n\t\\- Many students and academic writers think like the early ship owners when it comes to note-taking. They handle their ideas and findings in the way it makes immediate sense: If they read an interesting sentence, they underline it. If they have a comment to make, they write it into the margins. If they have an idea, they write it into their notebook, and if an article seems important enough, they make the effort and write an excerpt. Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places. Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where and when these notes were written down. A text must then be conceptualised independently from these notes, which explains why so many resort to brainstorming to arrange the resources afterwards according to this preconceived idea.\n\nThe note archive is a safe place for unjustified inklings to grow.\n\t\\- Steven Johnson, who wrote an insightful book about how people in science and in general come up with genuine new ideas, calls it the “slow hunch.” As a precondition to make use of this intuition, he emphasises the importance of experimental spaces where ideas can freely mingle (Johnson 2011). A laboratory with open-minded colleagues can be such a space, much as intellectuals and artists freely discussed ideas in the cafés of old Paris. I would add the slip-box as such a space in which ideas can mingle freely, so they can give birth to new ones.\n\n## Morale while writing\n\nNote-taking practices can turn writing into a predictable, actionable process (“start from abundance”). [[z3PBVkZ2SvsAgFXkjHsycBeyS6Cw1QXf7kcD8:::Executable strategy for writing]]\n\t\\- To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read.\n\n[[z8d4eJNaKrVDGTFpqRnQUPRkexB7K6XbcffAV:::Close open loops]]\n\t\\- Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts.\n\n[[z6C5H4eYH2A4omfNLuUcDiKibQ1hZG2RGNZ97:::Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)]]\n\t\\- As the outcome of each task is written down and possible connections become visible, it is easy to pick up the work any time where we left it without having to keep it in mind all the time.\n\t\\- All this enables us to later pick up a task exactly where we stopped without the need to “keep in mind” that there still was something to do. That is one of the main advantages of thinking in writing – everything is externalised anyway.\n\nZettelkasten is a great release valve for editing. Material which isn’t essential for a particular piece can become a durable note, providing value later. Or, flipping this around, if the writing *began* with the note archive, then there’s no harm in deleting manuscript material, since it lives on elsewhere. [[z26G5QDZgkk3mLTJoWHfzM6kjRzHpTAWHeZWN:::Evergreen notes lower the emotional stakes in editing manuscripts]]\n\t\\- One of the most difficult tasks is to rigorously delete what has no function within an argument – “kill your darlings.”[42] This becomes much easier when you move the questionable passages into another document and tell yourself you might use them later.\n\nNotes are a way to focus on “inputs, not outputs” that isn’t just about time. [[z3PBVkZ2SvsAgFXkjHsycBeyS6Cw1QXf7kcD8:::Executable strategy for writing]] [[z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be:::Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work]]\n\nsense of ease\n\t\\- He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn’t feel like, he even said: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)[4]\n\t\\- “When I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else.” When he was asked what else he did when he was stuck, his answer was: “Well, writing other books. I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.”\n\t\\- This is partly due to the aforementioned Zeigarnik effect (Zeigarnik 1927), in which our brains tend to stay occupied with a task until it is accomplished (or written down). If we have the finish line in sight, we tend to speed up, as everyone knows who has ever run a marathon.\n\nLitmus test: all that matters is writing. All activities should lead to writing\n\t\\- Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus.\n\n---\n\n## Unsorted\n\n*   Abstraction is also the key to analyse and compare concepts, to make analogies and to combine ideas; this is especially true when it comes to interdisciplinary work (Goldstone and Wilensky 2008). Being able to abstract and re-specify ideas is, again, only one side of the equation. It is not good for anything if we don’t have a system in place that allows us to put this into practice. Here, it is the concrete standardization of notes in just one format that enables us to literally shuffle them around, to add one idea to multiple contexts and to compare and combine them in a creative way without losing sight of what they truly contain.\n\n*   We don’t need to worry about the question of what to write about because we have answered the question already – many times on a daily basis. Every time we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing down and what is not.\n\n*   It is the one decision in the beginning, to make writing the mean and the end of the whole intellectual endeavour, that changed the role of topic-finding completely. It is now less about finding a topic to write about and more about working on the questions we generated by writing.\n\n*   That is why we need to elaborate on it. But elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way. The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well.\n\n\n\n\n",

For example, I might collect a list of assumptions in one *Zettel* which serves as an overview. like  [hard determinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism) . A related argument and its conclusion will be kept in another *Zettel*.  [Moral responsibility under hard determinism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_responsibility#Hard_determinism)  is a good example. I can re-use the arguments without buying into the assumptions because the arguments are of sufficiently general form. Atomicity fosters re-use which in turn multiplies the amount of connections in the network of *Zettels.*\n\n\n\n\n",

            "contentMarkdown": "# Executable strategy for writing\n\nA naive writing process begins with a rough inkling about what one wants to write and a blank page. Progress from this point requires an enormous amount of activation energy and cognitive effort: there’s nothing external, so you must juggle all of the piece-to-be in your head.\n\nBy contrast, if you’ve already written lots of concept-oriented [[z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C:::Evergreen notes]] around the topic, your task is more like editing than composition. You can make an outline by shuffling the note titles, write notes on any missing material, and edit them together into a narrative. In fact, because you can [[z2uXyfV67dnWLUKg1iDbsrHk3DGjtNWTxSTah:::Create speculative outlines while you write]], you might find that the first of these steps is already accomplished, too. And writing each note isn’t hard: [[z6C5H4eYH2A4omfNLuUcDiKibQ1hZG2RGNZ97:::Evergreen notes permit smooth incremental progress in writing (“incremental writing”)]].\n\nInstead of having a task like “write an outline of the first chapter,” you have a task like “find notes which seem relevant.” Each step feels doable. This is an executable strategy (see [[z53fk5XwrsnueNDDCq6WNe2VbPhrDGQmmVgNS:::Executable strategy]]). But beware—don’t let this strategy “poison” the initial note-writing process: [[z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J:::Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]].\n\nI describe two approaches here: an **undirected** version, in which writing projects emerge organically from daily work; and a **directed** version, in which you’re trying to write about something specific.\n\n## Undirected version:\n\n1.  Write durable notes continuously while reading and thinking. ([[z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be:::Evergreen note-writing as fundamental unit of knowledge work]])\n2.  Each time you add a note, add a link to it to an outline, creating one if necessary ([[z2uXyfV67dnWLUKg1iDbsrHk3DGjtNWTxSTah:::Create speculative outlines while you write]]).\n3.  Eventually, you’ll feel excited about fleshing out one of those outlines. ([[z5uSCvx3W2GdzBVhWAAXrrCcykJ8SHimdJzg7:::Let ideas and beliefs emerge organically]])\n4.  Write new notes to fill in missing pieces of the outline.\n5.  Concatenate all the note texts together to get an initial manuscript\n6.  Rewrite it.\n\n## Directed version:\n\n1.  Review notes related to your topic (and a step or two beyond those—[[z4KZ9973AoHhvM9Pj5Qrds48JXNbMEwVJmVRw:::Notes should surprise you]])\n2.  Write an outline\n3.  Attach existing notes to each point in the outline; write new notes as needed.\n4.  Concatenate all the note texts together to get an initial manuscript\n5.  Rewrite it.\n\nOne other nice benefit of this approach: [[z26G5QDZgkk3mLTJoWHfzM6kjRzHpTAWHeZWN:::Evergreen notes lower the emotional stakes in editing manuscripts]].\n\n---\n\n## References\n\nAhrens, S. (2017). *How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers*.\n\n[Preparing Fragments Helps You to Ease Into Writing • Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/ease-into-writing/)\n\n\u003e To see with clarity if your research backs up your text’s structure sufficiently, the next step is to assign notes from your *Zettelkasten* to the items of your outline. When an item of your outline seems to be neglected because you don’t have enough notes that fit, you can continue your research, focusing on the missing pieces. As soon as you’re confident you got enough coverage for a start, you string the notes’s contents together according to the outline. Thus you create the very first draft. That’s all it takes to move from a plan to outline to manuscript. Then you begin to re-write, organize the material and start to make the text coherent.\n\n\u003e There’s no magic involved in writing texts with the help of a well-fed *Zettelkasten*. To compile a first draft you put the contents of selected notes at the appropriate places in the outline, putting meat on the bones of your text’s skeleton. That’s how a *Zettelkasten* helps you complete your first draft.\n\n\n\n\n",

That might mean providing all the necessary background to understand some (boring to you) idea, or self-censoring, or adding lots of qualifiers, or spending lots of effort on clarity. Many of these practices can be somewhat useful as part of your own thinking process—for instance, clearer writing usually involves clearer thinking. But I find it substantially increases the overhead and effort in writing, often to the point of producing blockage."
